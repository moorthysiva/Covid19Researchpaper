Abstract The etiologic basis for the vast majority of cases of congenital heart disease remains largely undefined. Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.',\n 'Clinical and immunologic studies in identical twins discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus. Abstract Middle-aged female identical twins, one of whom had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were evaluated for immunologic reactivity to previous antigenic challenges, including primary immunization with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies. Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization. This observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of SLE.',\n 'Epidemiology of community-acquired respiratory tract infections in adults Incidence, etiology, and impact. Abstract Upper respiratory tract infections are the most common types of infectious diseases among adults. It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.',\n 'Infectious diarrhea: Pathogenesis and risk factors. Abstract Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding infectious diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study.',\n 'New perspectives on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Abstract In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.',\n 'Management of acute and chronic respiratory tract infections. Abstract Pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia represent the most common respiratory tract infections. With a view to establishing effective management strategies, the origins of these illnesses and the diagnostic techniques that have been developed to discover them are reviewed. Therapeutic regimens with documented efficacy are outlined with emphasis on specific rather than empiric treatment. Although many respiratory tract pathogens remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, the emergence of resistant strains underscores the need for safe and effective alternative therapies.',\n 'Acute bronchitis: Results of U.S. and European trials of antibiotic therapy. Abstract Acute bronchitis, an illness frequently encountered by primary-care physicians, is an inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree that results from a respiratory tract infection. It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents. Loracabef was as well tolerated as cefaclor and amoxicillin; moreover, it produced a significantly lower incidence of diarrhea than did amoxicillin/clavulanate. Loracarbef may be considered a safe and effective alternative agent for the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis.',\n 'Determination of microsomal lauric acid hydroxylase activity by HPLC with flow-through radiochemical quantitation. Abstract An assay for the microsomal hydroxylation of lauric acid (LA), based on HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection, has been developed. Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(ω)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(ω-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(ω-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, α-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [ω-, (ω-1)-, (ω-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.',\n 'Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase exhibit proton translocating activity in the presence of gramicidin. Abstract Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COV) were characterized for electron transfer and proton translocating activities in the presence of the mobile potassium ionophore, valinomycin, and the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin, in order to determine if the ionophores modify the functional properties of the enzyme. In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.',\n 'The oligomeric structure of renal aminopeptidase N from bovine brush-border membrane vesicles. Abstract Bovine renal brush-border membrane vesicle aminopeptidase N at various stages of purity was treated with two bifunctional cross-linking agents. A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies identify multiple epitopes on maize leaf nitrate reductase. Abstract Nine hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies against the maize leaf nitrate reductase have been distinguished by reciprocal competition for binding to the antigenic site. Inhibition of enzymatic activities, and western blots of native enzyme and denatured subunits revealed different behaviors of individual antibodies towards the antigen. Two classes of monoclonal antibodies are inhibitory of NADH and methyl viologen nitrate reductase activities, but only one affects also NADH cytochrome c reductase activity. The associated epitopes are sensitive to antigen conformation. Among the 4 other classes, one is specific for the native conformation of the molecule, another binds more strongly to the denatured antigen, and two recognize equally well the two forms.',\n 'Predict7, a program for protein structure prediction. Abstract We describe a program for protein sequence analysis which runs in IBM PC computers. Protein sequences are loaded from files in Mount-Conrad and Lipman-Pearson format. Seven features are analyzed: hydrophilicity, hydropathy, surface probability, side chain flexibility, antigenicity, secondary structure and N-glycosylation sites. Numeric results can be shown, printed or stored in files exportable to other programs.

Abstract Dieldrin (36 mg/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally prolonged recovery from infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in the genetically-resistant A/J strain, affected the humoral anti-MHV3 IgG immune response, and inhibited the intrinsic antiviral activity of peritoneal macrophages upon in vitro rechallenge with the virus. Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.',\n 'Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of carbodine, the carbocyclic analogue of cytidine. Abstract Carbocyclic cytidine (C-Cyd) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active against DNA viruses [pox (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [toga (Sindbis, Semliki forest), corona], (−)RNA viruses [orthomyxo (influenza), paramyxo (parainfluenza, measles), rhabdo (vesicular stomatitis)] and (±)RNA viruses (reo). The target enzyme of C-Cyd is supposed to be CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this assumption are the observations that (i) C-Cyd effects a dose-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in both virus-infected and uninfected cells, and (ii) exogenous addition of either Urd or Cyd reverses both the antiviral and cytocidal activity of C-Cyd, whereas addition of dThd or dCyd fails to do so. The selectivity of C-Cyd against Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis and reo virus is markedly increased when C-Cyd is combined with Cyd (10 μg/mL). This combination may therefore be worth pursuing as a chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of virus infections.',\n 'Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells and mouse leukemia L1210 cells by N-hydroxy-N′-aminoguanidine derivatives. Abstract A series of N-hydroxy-N′-aminoguanidine (HAG) derivatives were studied and compared for their effects on ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts; on nucleic acid synthesis and the growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells; and on mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The HAG derivatives [RCH\\ue5fbNNHC(\\ue5fbNH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2′,3′,4′-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.',\n 'Antitumor activity and biochemical effects of topsentin. Abstract Topsentin, a bis(indolyl)imidazole marine natural product, inhibited the proliferation of cultured human and murine tumor cells at micromolar concentrations (ic50 values ranged from 4 to 40 μM) and was active against in vivo P388 leukemia (% T C = 137, 150 mg/kg , QD1-5) and B16 melanoma (% T C = 144, 37.5 mg/kg , QD1-9) tumors. Effects of 30 μM topsentin (1-hr exposures) on incorporation of radiolabeled precursors by P388 cells indicated inhibition of DNA synthesis (91%) and to a lesser extent RNA synthesis (57%), whereas synthesis of protein was unaffected (0%). Fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide indicated that topsentin interacted with DNA. No evidence for intercalation was observed in DNA unwinding studies, but competitive binding experiments with Hoechst 33342 and CC-1065 indicated that topsentin bound to DNA in the minor groove.',\n 'Broad-spectrum antiviral and cytocidal activity of cyclopentenylcytosine, a carbocyclic nucleoside targeted at CTP synthetase. Abstract Cyclopentenylcytosine (Ce-Cyd) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active against DNA viruses [herpes (cytomegalo), pox (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [picorna (polio, Coxsackie, rhino), toga (Sindbis, Semliki forest), corona], (−)RNA viruses [orthomyxo (influenza), paramyxo (parainfluenza, measles), arena (Junin, Tacaribe), rhabdo (vesicular stomatitis)] and (±)RNA viruses (reo). Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases.',\n 'Inhibition of aminopeptidases N, A and W A re-evaluation of the actions of bestatin and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. Abstract The effects of a range of metallopeptidase inhibitors on the activities of the porcine kidney cell surface zinc aminopeptidases, aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.2), aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.7) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16), have been directly compared. Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5–20 μM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 μM of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 μm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 μM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 μM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 μM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 μM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.',\n 'Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: Neuropsychiatric presentation. Abstract Limbic encephalitis as a distinct clinicopathological entity is becoming increasingly familiar to neurologists. However, despite its classical clinical presentation of mental status changes and behavioral abnormalities, the disorder is not well known in the psychiatric literature and premortem diagnosis is rare. We recently participated in the care of a patient who spent two months on a psychiatric service and in whom a medical disorder was consistently suspected but not confirmed until autopsy revealed paraneoplasic limbic encephalitis and two primary systemic malignancies. A detailed neuropsychiatric description of this clinical entity is provided from presentation to autopsy with review of the literature.',\n 'The relationship between axonal transport of protein and demyelination in the optic nerves of mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus. Abstract Fast and slow axonal transport of protein have been studied in the optic nerves of mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) that causes patchy demyelination throughout the CNS. Intravitreal injections of [3H]proline were given at regular intervals after virus inoculation, the labelled protein in the superior colliculi was then measured after survival periods of 18 h or 10 days, for fast and slow axonal transport studies, respectively. Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection.',\n 'Regulation of astrocyte proliferation by prostaglandin E2 and the α subtype of protein kinase C. Abstract We found that astrocytes expressed the α subtype of protein kinase C. Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.',\n 'Polarity of processes with Golgi apparatus in a subpopulation of type I astrocytes. Abstract The Golgi apparatus-complex (GA), is a key organelle involved in several posttranslational modifications of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, plasma membranes and secretion. As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.',\n 'Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Abstract Astrocytes produce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and support the survival and proliferation of microglia. To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.',\n 'Diarrhoea in the dog and cat I. Acute diarrhoea. Abstract Faeces are not always uniform in consistency. Many owners believe that variations in faecal consistency are abnormal, but consistency may vary during one evacuation, i.e. initially firm but latterly soft, or over the day, e.g. the initial morning faeces are frequently firmer than those passed later in the day. It is normal for a dog to defaecate more than twice daily. The accepted range of normality for the dog and cat is one to four times daily although this depends on the diet. The faecal output of a dog fed on a dry, complete diet may be twice that on a meat-based diet. The addition of dog biscuit to the meat has little effect upon faecal bulk as most biscuit is low in fibre.',\n 'Immune-mediated diseases of the dog and cat III. Immune-mediated diseases of the integumentary, urogenital, endocrine and vascular systems. Abstract The first two articles in this series have covered the basis of the immune mediated diseases, systemic immune-mediated diseases and those that involve the haemolymphatic and musculoskeletal system. The purpose of this article is to cover the immune-mediated diseases that involve the integumentary, urogenital, endocrine and vascular systems.',\n 'Characterization of an influenza A (H3N2) virus isolated from pigs in England in 1987. Abstract This study describes the isolation and characterization of an influenza virus subtype H3N2 designated A/Swine/Weybridge/163266/87. The virus was isolated from a severe outbreak of respiratory disease in East Anglia. Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase characterization showed the virus to be very similar to H3N2 strains circulating in the human population during the years 1972–1975, and to H3N2 strains recently isolated from pigs in Belgium and France. A serological survey showed antibodies to the virus to be present in 31% of pigs tested, and reactors were detected on 43% of farms sampled.',\n 'Blood biochemical reference ranges for sows under modern management conditions. Abstract Published reference ranges for blood biochemistry in swine generally do not relate to sows in modern breeding units, and results were often obtained by methods that are now outdated. The ranges widely used in clinical practice reflect these inappropriate sources. The data presented here were obtained using modern methods of analysis on blood samples from healthy, conventionally managed sows from six breeding herds of known disease status in eastern England, and thus represent appropriate ranges for this class of swine. The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins. The latter are shown to be due to higher immunoglobulin concentrations than those previously reported.',\n 'An ELISA for the detection of serum antibodies to both transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus. Abstract A competition ELISA utilizing a mAb directed towards a peplomer protein epitope common to TGEV, PRCV and related feline and canine coronaviruses is described.',\n 'Feline immunodeficiency virus: A brief review. Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), previously known as feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (FTLV), was first described by Pedersen et al. (1987) who isolated the virus from cats with a variety of clinical signs suggestive of immunodeficiency. Since then FIV has become one of the most studied feline viruses, not least because of its similarity to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) which cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in man.',\n 'Equine arteritis virus: An overview. Abstract The causative agent of the respiratory disease equine viral arteritis is a small, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome organization and replication strategy related to that of coronaviruses and toroviruses. Clinical signs of infection in horses vary widely and severe infection can lead to pregnant mares aborting. Infected horses generally make good recoveries but stallions may become semen shedders of equine arteritis virus (EAV). These carrier stallions play an important role in the dissemination and perpetuation of EAV. Laboratory tests exist to detect virus and the equine immune response to infection. However, vaccines are not currently licensed in the UK to combat viral arteritis, the incidence of which may increase due to changes in European legislation.',\n 'Recent advances in avian virology. Abstract Selected, recent research on the following avian diseases, and their causative viruses, has been reviewed: chicken anaemia, infectious bursal disease, turkey rhinotracheitis, avian nephritis, fowlpox, influenza, infectious bronchitis and turkey enteritis.',\n 'Central nervous system myelin: structure, function, and pathology. Multiple sclerosis (MS) and a number of related distinctive diseases are characterized by the active degradation of central nervous system (CNS) myelin, an axonal sheath comprised essentially of proteins and lipids. These demyelinating diseases appear to arise from complex interactions of genetic, immunological, infective, and biochemical mechanisms. While circumstances of MS etiology remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves recognition by the immune system of myelin-specific antigens derived from myelin basic protein (MBP), the most abundant extrinsic myelin membrane protein, and/or another equally susceptible myelin protein or lipid component. Knowledge of the biochemical and physical—chemical properties of myelin proteins and lipids, particularly their composition, organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the compacted myelin multilayers, thus becomes central to the understanding of how and why these antigens become selected during the development of MS. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis underlying demyelinating disease as it may relate to the impact of the various protein and lipid components on myelin morphology; the precise molecular architecture of this membrane as dictated by protein—lipid and lipid—lipid interactions; and the relationship, if any, between the protein/lipid components and the destruction of myelin in pathological situations.',\n 'A computer based system for collection, storage, retrieval and reporting accession information in a veterinary medical diagnostic laboratory. Abstract Substantial data collected from large numbers of accessions, the need for comprehensive reporting of negative as well as positive laboratory findings, and the necessity for obtaining rapid diagnostic correlations prompted the development of a computer based system of accession data management for collection, storage, rapid retrieval, reporting, concording, and administrative compiling in a state-university Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.',\n 'Morphology and morphogenesis of a coronavirus infecting intestinal epithelial cells of newborn calves. Abstract The morphology and morphogenesis of virus strain LY-138 recovered from neonatal diarrheic calves were investigated by electron microscopy using negativestaining techniques and ultrathin sectioning. Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents.',\n 'Visceral target organs in systemic St. Louis encephalitis virus infection of hamsters. Abstract Ultrastructural aspects of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection of the major extraneutral organs and tissues of suckling hamsters were examined. In the pancreas, both the exocrine and endocrine portions were equally affected by the virus. A feature apparently unique to flaviviruses was the accumulation of virus particles in all types of secretory granules in this organ. Virus particles were seen within myocardial fibers and within the smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of small blood vessels of the heart. In the intestines, the lamina propria was the most severely infected, with virus particles accumulated in all cell types.',\n 'Leptomeningitis and polycaryocyte formation in the CNS of rats inoculated subcutaneously with Herpes simplex virus. Abstract Wistar rats were inoculated subcutaneously with either type 1 (HSV1) or type 2 (HSV2) Herpes simplex virus at 5 days of age. Animals were killed in extremis or at the end of the 14-day observation period postinoculation. Acute destructive meningoencephalitis with hemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration was observed in both groups. Polycaryocytes comprised of cells of the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were observed in some animals inoculated with HSV1. These multinucleated cells appeared to be formed by fusion of virus-infected cells, and intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed. Lesions in the leptomeninges were particularly striking in animals inoculated with HSV2. Viral replication in resident cells of the leptomeninges was demonstrated by electron microscopy.',\n 'Development of a murine model to study the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection. Abstract A murine model to study enteritis induced by bovine (BRV) and murine rotavirus (MRV) has been developed. The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods. Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice. Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period. Following infection with 104 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10–15 HPI. Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5–8 HPI. The appearance of diarrheal symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated. The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 × 102 PFU/mouse of BRV and 1 × 101 PFU/mouse of MRV. On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model. The model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies. This work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model.',\n 'Bovine coronavirus antigen in the host cell plasmalemma. Abstract Expression of bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen in the plasmalemma of epithelioid human rectal tumor (HRT-18) and fibroblastic bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cell lines was traced by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy facilitated by colloidal gold. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.',\n 'Formation and activity of covalent conjugates of poliovirus and ligands binding to cell surface structures. Abstract Disulfide-linked conjugates of poliovirus with streptavidin or concanavalin A were formed and the binding of the conjugates to mouse L cells that lack natural poliovirus receptors was studied. The conjugate with streptavidin was specifically bound to biotinylated L cells, but not to unmodified L cells. The conjugate with conA was bound to L cells in the absence of, but not in the presence of α-methyl mannoside. Incubation of L cells with bound conjugates did not produce virus, although the conjugates were highly infectious in HeLa cells, containing natural poliovirus receptors. This suggests that the artificially bound virus was unable to penetrate the L cells and start replication. The possibility that binding of the virus to the natural receptor is required for efficient infection is discussed.',\n \"Transient hyperglycosylation of rhodopsin with galactose. Abstract Rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chains contain predominantly two types of sugar residues: mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a β-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with β-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8–9% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2·2% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.\",\n 'Expression of Ia antigen on perivascular and microglial cells after sublethal and lethal motor neuron injury. Abstract The expression of immune-associated (MHC class II) antigen was studied immunohistochemically over several months in the rat facial nucleus after nerve transection and after intraneural injection of toxic ricin. Cells expressing Ia antigen were of a perivascular type and parenchymal ramified microglia. In the first few weeks after nerve lesions we observed a gradual increase in the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells starting with an initial appearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells which were succeeded by increasing numbers of Ia-positive ramified microglia. In long-term animals Ia expression was almost exclusively found in microglia. We propose (a) the existence of a population of immunocompetent perivascular cells normally present in adult rat brain that can be stimulated to express Ia antigen, and (b) the existence of a subpopulation of ramified microglia that arises through transformation of Ia-positive perivascular cells in the adult under pathological conditions.',\n 'Analogous amino acid sequences in myelin proteolipid and viral proteins. Abstract Computer analysis of the intrinsic membrane protein, myelin proteolipid, shows strong sequence similarities between the putative extramembrane segments of the proteolipid protein and a number of viral proteins, several of which infect humans. These similarities are even more striking than those reported previously between viral proteins and the encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP). These findings, along with other reports of molecular mimicry by viruses, suggest that immunological cross-reactions between virus-induced antibodies or T-cells and analogous antigenic determinants (epitopes) in myelin proteolipid could be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis or post-infectious demyelinating syndromes.',\n 'Stop making sense or Regulation at the level of termination in eukaryotic protein synthesis. Abstract An increasing number of examples of translational regulation at the level of termination has been recently reported in eukaryotes. This paper reviews our present knowledge on this topic and proposes an understanding of these regulations by relating the study of viral gene expression to a comprehensive view of the mechanisms and components of the translational process.',\n 'A novel superfamily of nucleoside triphosphate-binding motif containing proteins which are probably involved in duplex unwinding in DNA and RNA replication and recombination. Abstract A statistically significant similarity was demonstrated between the amino acid sequences of 4 Escherichia coli helicases and helicase subunits, a family of non-structural proteins of eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses and 2 herpesvirus proteins all of which contain an NTP-binding sequence motif. Based on sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions, a generalized structural model for the ATP-binding core is proposed. It is suggested that all these proteins constitute a superfamily of helicases (or helicase subunits) involved in NTP-dependent duplex unwinding during DNA and RNA replication and recombination.',\n 'Endosomal association of a protein phosphatase with high dephosphorylating activity against a coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Abstract On the assumption that dephosphorylation of the neurotropic coronavirus JHM (JHMV) nucleocapsid protein (N) may be connected with initiation of the infectious cycle we searched for a relevant host enzyme activity. Analysis of subcellular fractions from L-2 murine fibroblasts, separated by dual Percoll density gradients, revealed the presence of a phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase), co-sedimenting with the endososomal/prelysosomal material, which possesses high activity against N. With purified [22P]N as substrate it was demonstrated that this PPPase, distinguishable from acid and alkaline phosphatases, acts optimally at neutral pH in the presence of Mn2+ following treatment with a detergent. Complete inhibition with okadaic acid at 0.9–4.5 μM but not at 1–10 nM relegates this PPase to a type I protein phosphatase. Similar PPPase activity for N was present in the endosome fraction of a rat Roc-1 astrocytoma-oligodendrocyte cell line and in homogenates of brain and cultured oligodendrocytes. Our data suggest that the phosphorylated N of the inoculum may be modified by the endosomal PPPase in host cells, including those from the CNS so as to facilitate the JHMV infectious process.',\n 'Putative papain-related thiol proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses Identification of rubi- and aphthovirus proteases and delineation of a novel conserved domain associated with proteases of rubi-, α- and coronaviruses. Abstract A computer-assisted comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of (putative) thiol proteases encoded by the genomes of several diverse groups or positive-stranded RNA viruses and distantly related to the family of cellular papain-like proteases is presented. A high level of similarity was detected between the leader protease of foot-and-mouth-disease virus and the protease of murine hepatitis coronavirus which cleaves the N-terminal p28 protein from the polyprotein. Statistically significant alignment of a portion of the rubella virus polyprotein with cellular papain-like proteases was obtained, leading to tentative identification of the papain-like protease as the enzyme mediating processing of the non-structural proteins of this virus. Specific grouping between the sequences of the proteases of α-viruses, and poty- and bymoviruses was revealed. It was noted that papain-like proteases of positive-stranded RNA viruses are much more variable both in their sequences and in genomic locations than chymotrypsin-related proteases found in the same virus class. A novel conserved domain of unknown function has also been identified which flanks the papain-like proteases of α-, rubi- and coronaviruses.',\n 'Acidic pH induces fusion of cells infected with baculovirus to form syncytia. Abstract The enveloped baculovirus⧹insect cell system has been used extensively for expression of recombinant proteins. including viral fusion proteins. We tested wild-type baculovirus for endogenous fusion protein activity. Syncytia formation, dye transfer, and capacitance changes were observed after incubating infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells in acidic media, consistent with fusion protein activity. Only a short acidic pulse or 10 s is needed to trigger syncytia formation. Identical results were obtained with recombinant baculovirus. This new system convenient for studying pH activated cell-cell fusion. However, using this enveloped virus to study the mechanism of recombinant fusion proteins requires caution.',\n 'Identification of an aprotinin antiviral domain. Abstract Digestion of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, by clostripain, a cysteine proteinase, yielded five oligopeptide fragments. Two fragments exhibited both antiviral and antibacterial activities, two fragments only antiviral activity, and one fragment showed no antimicrobial activity. One of the former oligopeptides showed antiviral activity against human herpes simplex virus type 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3. It consisted of the hexapeptide Y-F-Y-N-A-K corresponding to amino acids 21–26 of intact aprotinin. An identical synthetic peptide had the same antiviral spectrum as the natural hexapeptide, exhibited no antibacterial activity, and was also devoid of trypsin inhibiting activity. Intact aprotinin, in contrast, is ineffective against human herpes simplex virus 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 but possesses antibacterial properties against several bacterial species [(1992) J. Appl. Bact. 72, 180–187].',\n 'Overexpression of TGN38/41 leads to mislocalisation of γ-adaptin. Abstract TGN38 and TGN41 are isoforms of a monotopic integral membrane protein which recycles between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the cell surface, but which, at steady state, is predominantly located in the TGN. Full-length and truncated versions of rat TGN38/41 have been expressed in monkey (COS) and human (Heb7a) cells under the control of the heavy metal inducible Metallothionein IIA promoter. This has allowed the regulated expression of TGN38/41 protein constructs to different levels in the transfected cells. These studies show that (i) controlled overexpression of TGN38/41 results in mislocalisation to parts of the endocytic pathway, (ii) a truncated version of TGN38/41, lacking the cytoplasmic domain, remains in the TGN, and (iii) there is a direct or indirect interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 and γ-adaptin.',\n 'Disposition of the car☐y-terminus tail of rabbit lactase-phlorizin hydrolase elucidated by phosphorylation with protein kinase A in vitro and in tissue culture. Abstract The intracellular disposition of the car☐y-terminus tail of rabbit lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) is demonstrated, using a specific phosphorylation of Ser1916 by protein kinase A (PKA). This phosphorylation is shown to occur not only in vitro (with pure LPH and pure catalytic subunit of PKA), but also in an organ culture of the small intestine. Cholera toxin, which is known to act in vivo on the membranes of the small intestine, with severe clinical consequences, and to elevate the intracellular cyclic AMP of enterocytes, is shown to enhance significantly the phosphorylation of LPH in intact cells grown as an organ culture. These findings establish the cytosolic orientation of the car☐yterminus tail of LPH in situ, and raise the possibility that the tail itself and its phosphorylation by PKA may have a physiological or physiopathological significance.',\n 'Demonstration of a difference in expression of maximal lactase and sucrase activity along the villus in the adult rat jejunum. Abstract Lactase and sucrase are two disaccharidases that differ not only in their substrate specificity and developmental patterns, but also in their resistance to mucosal insult. In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a dichotomy in expression of enzyme activity along the jejunal villuscrypt unit. Sectioning of the villus-crypt unit in a cryostat enabled direct comparison of the distribution of lactase and sucrase enzyme activities in the adult rat. There is a stepwise increase in mean lactase/sucrase ratio going from crypt to villus. The data indicate that unlike sucrase activity, which is expressed maximally in enterocytes along the entire villus, maximal lactase activity is not attained until midvillus. The delay in expression of maximal lactase activity might help to explain the vulnerability of this enzyme to acute mucosal insult such as occurs in viral gastroenteritis.',\n 'Influence of coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infection on jejunal myoelectrical activity of the neonatal pig. Abstract Four silver—silver chloride electrodes were surgically implanted at 5-cm intervals on the jejunal serosa of 7 neonatal pigs. Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena. These findings suggest that infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus disrupts organized propulsive activity in the jejunum of the neonatal pig.',\n 'Fundamentals of gastroenterology with self-assessment work book.

A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal l-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2–7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to l-glutamine (30 mmol/L) Sand l-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal d-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na+ absorption to a similar degree (2–2.5 μEq · cm−2 · h−1), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaC1 absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl− flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea.',\n 'Electrolyte transport in piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus Stimulation by verapamil and clonidine. Abstract The effects of clonidine, an α 2-adrenergic agonist, and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on Na2+ and Cl− absorption were studied in stripped jejunal mucosa from control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-infected piglets. All infected piglets developed severe diarrhea 18–24 hours after oral inoculation. Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl− fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl− absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl− absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, d-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in shortcircuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.',\n \"An in-depth study of Crohn's disease in two French families. Abstract Background: Two French families were investigated. In the first a husband, wife, and 4 children had Crohn's disease; in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease. There was no history of Crohn's disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to HLA haplotypes. Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemistry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7–13-month periods. There appeared to be a 4–8-year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Campylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Brucella, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals. Conclusions: The circumstances and data suggest that an infectious microorganism is responsible for these clusterings of Crohn's disease.\",\n \"Immunocytochemical evidence of Listeria, Escherichia coil, and Streptococcus antigens in Crohn's disease. Abstract Background/Aims Infectious agents have long been suspected of playing a role in the initiation of Crohn's disease. The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coli antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen. Conclusions The results suggest that Listeria spp., E. coli, and streptococci, but not measles virus, play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.\",\n \"Molar absorptivity and A1cm 1% values for proteins at selected wavelengths of the ultraviolet and visible regions—XVIII.

Abstract Antibodies against Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes were detected in green toad (Bufo viridis) sera by direct agglutination, indirect haemagglutination (IHA), complement-fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for comparisons between each of the techniques and regression formulae derived in order to convert antibody levels as determined by one immunological method to that of another. The highest mean titre obtained by ELISA was approximately 1.5–3.5 times greater than those obtained by the other techniques whilst CFT gave the lowest values. IHA and ELISA titres were affected by different preparations of the crithidial antigen extracts. Highly significant r values were determined for control sera when IHA was compared to ELISA (r > 0.79), and to both CFT and ELISA with immune animals (r > 0.96). ELISA would seem most applicable for screening other lower vertebrates for anti-parasite antibodies especially in areas of human disease prevalence.',\n 'Immunolabelling of fish host molecules on the tegumental surface of Ligula intestinalis (Cestoda: Ppseudophyllidea). Abstract Immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE and western biotting procedures were used to demonstrate cross-reactivity of a polyclonal anti-carp IgM antibody with components of roach serum. The polyclonal antibody labelled 2 major bands in both immune and normal roach sera corresponding to molecular mannes of approximately 90 and 65 kDa. One of these bands (65 kDa) was considered to be the heavy chain of fish immunoglobulin whilst the identity of the other remains uncertain. This cross-reaction has been exploited in immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling studies to localize fish host molecules on the tegumental membrane of Ligula intestinalis freshly removed from roach fry. Immunogold studies revealed a low level of host molecules to be associated mainly with the microthrix spines of the tegament with less gold labelling being observed on the microthrix shafts.',\n 'Identification of diagnostic antigens for South American Babesia caballi infections. Abstract Identification of diagnostic antigens for South American Babesia caballi infections. International Journal for Parasitology 24: 255–258. Sera from 60 horses held in breeding herd in Brazil were examined monthly by ELISA, immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blot. All foals had maternal antibodies detectable by ELISA and IFAT, and seroconversion took place between the 2nd and 5th month of age. The 48 and 50 kDa antigens were recognized first in the course of infection. Of 79 sera taken after sero-conversion 78 reacted with the 48 kDa antigen, 76 with the 50 kDa, 50 with the 70 kDa, 54 with the 112 kDa, 72 with the 141 kDa antigen. In general, sera from horses older than 1 year reacted with all 5 diagnostic antigen bands, but sera from horses older than 3 years only weakly. The antigens of 48 and 50 kDa appear to be conserved among all strains of B. caballi examined so far and are consistently recognized by all infected horses. They are the target antigens for a serological test based on anitigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques.',\n 'Diagnosis of Babesia caballi infections in horses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot. Abstract From Babesia caballi in vitro cultures a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes was obtained. From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing). Positive ELISA results can be confirmed by Western blot, if a species-specific diagnosis is required.',\n 'Electron microscopy of the intestine of gnotobiotic piglets infected with porcine rotavirus. Abstract Five gnotobiotic piglets inoculated orally with porcine rotavirus developed an enteric lesion. Electron microscopy of the mucosal epithelium 12 h after inoculation showed that the virus penetrates into the absorptive cells between microvilli, possibly by a pinocytic mechanism. Afterwards, virus particles were most often seen within dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These infected cells showed a range of changes, such as disruption of the microvilli, loss of cytoplasmic density and deposition of lipid droplets. Subsequently, most of the epithelial cells were desquamated from the villi. The interaction of virus and intestinal cells thus indicates that rotavirus is pathogenic for the epithelial cells.',\n 'The pathogenesis of nephritis in chickens induced by infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract Nephritis in chickens caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was studied by virological, histological and electron microscopical methods. The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules. A large number of viral inclusion bodies as seen containing dark smooth particles 120 nm in diameter within a single membrane. Virus was readily recovered from the kidneys as well as faeces of birds with acute and chronic nephritis. It is concluded that direct virus-induced cell lysis is the primary cause of IBV nephritis. In addition, about 50 per cent of the chronically infected birds also developed brush-border auto-antibody.',\n 'Propagation of bovine rotavirus by young dogs. Abstract Ten young dogs were experimentally infected twice with different isolates of bovine rotavirus and 2 uninfected dogs were kept in contact with them. None of the animals developed diarrhoea, but all of them excreted rotavirus in their faeces over a period of up to 10 days after each inoculation, as shown by counterimmunoelectro-osmophoresis and virus isolation. Dogs may thus play a role in the epizootiology of rotavirus diarrhoea in calves. Seroconversion occurred in 6 of the 10 infected dogs but in neither of the 2 contact controls.',\n 'Pathogenesis of infectious bronchitis nephritis 1. Morphometric analysis of kidney proximal tubular epithelium in chickens. Abstract The ultrastructure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells in chicken kidneys was examined throughout the course of an experimental infection with infectious bronchitis virus. A quantitative assessment of the structural changes in the cells was related to these in normal cells. Significant alterations were detected in the membrane structures and in the mitochondria. There was a reduction in surface area of the microvillus membrane, the basolateral membrane and the apical tubular membrane. There were alterations in the shape of mitochondrial profiles and a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria. Vesicular structures, which are a possible site of viral release, were observed in the lateral surface of cells. These changes in the functional components of the cells indicate impaired transport of ions and water. The results demonstrate the value of stereological methods for the study of viral-host cell interactions in the pathogenesis of viral disease.',\n 'Spontaneous and experimental myofibrillar hypoplasia and its relation to splayleg in newborn pigs. Abstract The relation of myofibrillar hypoplasia to clinical splayleg was studied. A strain of Belgian Landrace sows was selected for this study because they produced pigs which had no myfibrillar hypoplasia. Myofibrillar hypoplasia could nevertheless by induced experimentally in these animals by dexamethasone treatment of the sows during late pregnancy. The lesion was observed without clinical signs and was compared to the myofibrillar hypoplasia in clinical cases of splayleg. The differences between these 2 groups may account for the appearance of clinical signs. These differences included the maturity of the myofibrils and the degree of autophagosomal glycogen breakdown.',\n \"The tissue distribution of spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity effector lymphocytes in swine. Abstract Peripheral blood lymphocytes, intraepithelial lymphocytes from the small intestine and lymphocytes from the thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches from 5 young adult pigs were used as effector cells in a spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity chromium release assay against PK-15 cells persistently infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus as targets. Both peripheral blood and intraepithelial lymphocytes caused marked specific chromium release, while the lymphocytes from the remaining tissues were inactive in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\",\n 'Pathogenesis of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) in mice experimentally infected by different routes. Abstract Three-day-old suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) with the 67N strain of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) showed nervous signs and died. The virus was passaged 10 times in suckling mice and was designated the MB-67N strain. The pathogenesis of MB-67N was studied with various ages of mice and inoculation routes. All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe tocal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy. These findings indicate that the MB-67N propagates mainly in the central nervous system and nerve cells serve as a main target of virus replication.',\n 'Demonstration of viral antigen and immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) in brain tissue of pigs experimentally infected with haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Abstract Haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) was inoculated either orally or intranasally into ten 3-day-old gnotobiotic piglets. All infected pigs showed inappetence and listlessness, but there were no clinical signs of nervous disorder. Severe encephalomyelitis, characterized by neuronophagia, focal gliosis and perivascular cuffing, was observed in the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Nasally infected pigs, in particular, developed lesions in the area of the stria olfactoria and tractus olfactorius. Coincident with the encephalitic changes, HEV antigen was observed first in the trigeminal ganglion cells and then in degenerating neurones. Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM)-containing cells were also found in perivascular cuffs and glial foci. They appeared at first on PID 7 and after that increased in number. These findings suggest that these encephalitic lesions are a specific immune response to HEV following its multiplication in the central nervous system.',\n 'Feline non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis. A clinical and pathological study. Abstract A spontaneous neurological disease in cats characterized by behavioural and motor disturbances was investigated by clinical, morphological and immunological methods. Neuropathological examination showed a marked inflammatory reaction in the cerebral leptomeninges and the grey matter of the brain. In the white matter, the reaction was moderate. The changes consisted of perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells and neuronal damage. The brain stem (thalamus, mesencephalon, caudal colliculus) was most severely affected. The spinal cord and its leptomeninges were involved to a lesser degree. The histopathological picture as well as the laboratory findings suggests a viral cause of the disease. The morphology of the disease and serological as well as immunohistochemical results indicate that this disorder is different from previously known feline viral encephalitides.',\n 'Bovine herpesvirus-1-induced pharyngeal tonsil lesions in neonatal and weanling calves. Abstract The potential involvement of the pharyngeal tonsil in the pathogenesis of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) infection was examined in neonatal and weanling calves infected by intranasal aerosol. Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4·5, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses. The delayed inflammatory response and reduced viral clearance may contribute to the increased susceptibility of neonatal calves to fatal BHV-1 infections.',\n \"Pathogenicity and antigen detection of the Nouzilly strain of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, in 1-week-old piglets. Abstract We compared the pathogenicity and the sites of multiplication of the attenuated Nouzilly strain, with the highly passaged Purdue-115 and the virulent Gep II strains of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, in 1-week-old weaned piglets. The immunohistochemical peroxidase technique, with an antiviral nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody, was used for the localization of the multiplication sites, in the intestine and other organs. The Gep II and the Purdue-115 strains, administered orally to piglets, caused clinical signs and lesions of TGE. These strains multiplied within the intestinal tract in the enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In view of the small numbers of infected cells in the tonsils, spleen, kidney, liver and lung, these tissues are not considered to be preferential multiplication sites. The attenuated Nouzilly strain multiplies only in the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The variation in the tropism for particular parts of the intestine (with the preferential localization of the virus in the ileum rather than the jejunum), could be related to the high degree of attenuation of the Nouzilly strain.\",\n 'Autoradiographic detection of IgG and viral antigens. Abstract Autoradiographic methods can be used as an alternative to indirect immunofluorescence to detect viral antigen expression or the presence of IgG in tissue sections. Iodinated protein A isolated from Staphylococcus aureus detects an influx of IgG into the central nervous system of mice inoculated with the coronavirus SD. Antispecies antibody that has been iodinated detects coronavirus antigen expression for 24 days post-inoculation while it is only detectable for 10 days by immunofluorescence. A direct comparison of indirect fluorescence and autoradiographic methods indicates that the autoradiographic techniques are considerably more sensitive. This increased sensitivity is sufficient to permit the detection of viral antigen in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections.',\n 'Chemical linkage of erythrocytes and viral antigen in the hemolysis-in-gel (HIG) test for viral antibodies. Abstract The sensitivity of the hemolysis-in-gel (HIG) test with rubella antigen is not improved by chemical linkage of the virus to the erythrocytes, and after such modification, IgM specific antibodies are not detectable. In the influenza HIG test with tetraazotized o-dianisidine (TOD), chromic chloride and potassium periodate as coupling reagents, increased sensitivity was observed with allantoic fluid of infected eggs as antigen. If Tween-ether treated hemagglutinin is used in the HIG test, zones of hemolysis are detectable only after treatment of the erythrocytes with TOD, chromic chloride and potassium periodate.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies against bovine immunoglobulins and their use in isotype-specific ELISAs for rotavirus antibody. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (MCA) against bovine immunoglobulin (BIg) isotypes were produced and characterized. MCAs were obtained which react specifically with IgG, IgG1, IgG2 or IgA while MCAs against IgM showed a partial cross-reaction with affinity purified IgA. MCAs with optimal characteristics for application in ELISA were selected and used as conjugates in an indirect double antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) and as the capturing antibody in an antibody capture assay (ACA) for the isotype-specific detection of antibodies against rotavirus. Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2 anti-rotavirus antibodies. The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotypee reacted only in the homologous assay. The MCAs against bovine Ig isotypes and isotype-specific ELISAs were found to be very useful in the study of humoral mucosal immunity in calves infected with rotavirus.',\n 'Western and dot immunoblotting analysis of viral antigens and antibodies: Application to murine hepatitis virus. Abstract Viral proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred quantitatively to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in SDS-containing buffer. Monoclonal antibodies directed against previously defined epitopes on the viral proteins were used as probes to detect viral protein synthesis and processing, as well as expression in animal tissues. Circulating polyclonal antibodies were also probed and characterized for their polypeptide specificities. Under appropriate conditions, this Western immunoblotting technique was quantitative. Finally, a highly sensitive dot immunoblotting assay was used to analyze the sensitivity to denaturation of various epitopes on the viral proteins. This assay detected picogram quantities of viral antigens and antibodies.',\n \"Plaque/focus immunoassay: a simple method for detecting antiviral monoclonal or other antibodies and viral antigens in cells. Abstract A new, simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is described which is performed directly on infected and fixed cell cultures in microtitre plates. It permits large scale screening of antiviral monoclonal antibodies and differentiation of specific antibodies from those usually responsible for high background reactions in other ELISA techniques. Time consuming purification of antigens is thus avoided. The plaque/focus immunoassay is also applicable to titration of antibodies in patients' sera and antigens in lytically or non-lytically virus-infected cells. It may also be used to localize antigens in different cell compartments. This immunoassay requires no special equipment and results may be evaluated either with the naked eye or using a light microscope.\",\n 'A new conjugate for the ELISA quantitation of porcine IgA. Abstract The preparation of a new soluble immune complex conjugate (anti-IgA-IgA-peroxidase), suitable for use in the ELISA technique is described. This conjugate requires pure IgA and specific anti-IgA, but the enzyme (peroxidase) was easily conjugated to the IgA.',\n 'Measurement of the concentration of murine IgG monoclonal antibody in hybridoma supernatants and ascites in absolute units by sensitive and reliable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Abstract We have investigated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mouse IgG using affinity-purified goat anti-mouse antibodies for capture and detection. This assay was used to measure the absolute or weight/volume concentration of murine monoclonal antibody in hybridoma supernatants. Bovine or horse serum did not interfere with the assay, which permitted reliable measurement of all murine IgG subclasses except IgG3 in the 1–20 ng/ml range. Antibody capture was essentially complete in the optimized assay. In combination with an antigen-dependent ELISA, the assay allowed estimation of the absolute concentration of specific monoclonal antibody in ascites. These rapid and relatively simple assays may be applicable in many situations in which a practical means of measuring murine monoclonal antibodies in weight/volume units is needed.',\n 'Comparison of ascites production for monoclonal antibodies in BALB/c and BALB/c-derived cross-bred mice. Abstract BALB/c male mice were mated with either Swiss-Webster or MF1 females to produce first generation cross-bred offspring. Hybridoma cell lines, from the fusion of P3-NS1-Ag4/1 myeloma cells with spleen cells sensitised to the porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis, were injected intraperitoneally into these mice to produce ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies. Mice of 11 weeks of age weighing between 26 and 34 g were used. The volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross-bred offspring than in the BALB/c parent. The fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the MF1 cross-breed and BALB/c parent but a lesser volume in the Swiss-Webster cross-breed. The antibody titres of the ascites as determined by virus neutralisation, radioimmune and indirect immune fluorescence assays, did not differ significantly between mouse types. The ability to use all offspring from a litter of cross-bred mice, irrespective of sex, and the increased volume of ascitic fluid formed in each mouse, permits fewer animals to be used for the production of ascites in these strains, thereby offering considerable economic and ethical advantages over the use of BALB/c mice.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) immune to malaria. Abstract The B lymphocytes of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus can be immortalised by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (Desranges et al., 1976). C. jacchus is susceptible to infection with the blood stages of several species of malaria parasite including the line designated MVF1 (Mitchell et al., 1988) from which it recovers and shows immunity to reinfection. By exploiting these two phenomena, EBV-transformed, marmoset lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting antibodies to malaria parasite antigens have been generated and cloned. We believe this to be the first time that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been raised from common marmosets. Since numerous and diverse human pathogens can infect this small primate in the laboratory, these methods may prove generally applicable for the generation of MAbs whose specificities derive from immune responses to infection.',\n 'Kinetics of the in vitro antibody response to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus from pig mesenteric lymph node cells, using the ELISASPOT and ELISA tests. Abstract A method is described for in vitro studies of viral humoral immune responses in the pig. After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation. Extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system, it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig.',\n 'CD4 rat × rat and mouse × rat T cell hybridomas produced by fusion of established T cell lines and clones to W/Fu (C58NT)D. Abstract Previously, fusion of established T cell lines or clones has been claimed to be difficult. We now report our experiences in the fusion of both long term cultures of rat T cell clones and mouse T cell lines to rat W/Fu (C58NT)D. Upon fusion of rat T cell clones the hybrids obtained expressed antigen specificities identical to those of the parent clones. In addition, C58 was used for interspecies hybridisation of murine T cell lines. The specificity of intra- and inter-species hybrids was maintained by subcloning. We conclude that the C58 cell line can be used to generate continuously growing monoclonal T-cell reagents of sufficient stability using both intra- and inter-species hybri disation.',\n 'Isolation of sequences from a random-sequence expression library that mimic viral epitopes. Abstract We describe the use of random peptide sequences for the mapping of antigenic determinants. An oligonucleotide with a completely degenerate sequence of 17 or 23 nucleotides was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. This resulted in an expression library producing random hexa- or octapeptides attached to a β-galactosidase hybrid protein. Mimotopes, or antigenic sequences that mimic an epitope, were selected by immunoscreening of colonies with monoclonal antibodies, which were specific for antigenic sites on the spike protein of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. We report one mimotope for antigenic site II, eight for site III and one for site IV. The site III and site IV mimotopes were closely similar to the corresponding linear epitopes, localized previously in the amino acid sequence of the S protein. An alignment of the site II mimotope and the sequence of the S protein around Trp97, which is substituted in escape mutants, suggests that this mimotope mimics a conformational epitope located around residues 97–103. Applications of mimotopes to epitope mapping, serodiagnosis and vaccine development are discussed.',\n 'Effect of fixation on the detection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus antigens by the fixed-cell immunoperoxidase technique. Abstract The effect of various fixatives and detergents on the in vitro detection of the viral determinants which are expressed in swine testis cells infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was studied using a microwell immunoperoxidase technique. When compared with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, 0.1% paraformaldehyde was found to be the fixative of choice for the detection of these determinants on the membranes of infected cells. Among dehydrating fixatives, 80% acetone or a mixture of acetone and ethanol or of acetone, methanol and ethanol were found to be the best fixatives for the detection of these viral determinants which are expressed in infected cells. In the case of acetone, the temperature of fixation and its concentration in the fixative preparation were found to be important. The treatment of 0.05% glutaraldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 0.1% saponin or 0.1% paraformaldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 1%NP-40 led to satisfactory detection of viral determinants. Using Triton X-100 to render cells permeable, the quantities of N and M antigen detected in TGEV-infected cells prefixed with either 0.05% glutaraldehyde or 0.1% paraformaldehyde were equal to those of 80% acetone-fixed, TGEV-infected cells while the quantity of S antigen detected was diminished. The effect of other detergents such as zwittergent, embigen BB, Chaps and N-lauroylsarcosine on the detection of viral determinants was also studied.',\n 'A transient transfection system for identifying biosynthesized proteins processed and presented to class I MHC restricted T lymphocytes. Abstract CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute a major portion of immune responses to foreign and self antigens. CTL recognize class I major histocompatibility complex molecules complexed to peptides of 8–10 residues derived from cytosolic proteins. To understand CTL responses to these antigens to manipulate CTL responses optimally, it is necessary to identify the specific peptides recognized by CTL. The methods currently used for this purpose have significant drawbacks. We describe a plasmid transfection method that results in significant lysis of histocompatible target cells. Influenza virus-specific CTLs specifically lysed target cells that were transfected with plasmids bearing cDNAs encoding full length gene products, fragments containing the region that encodes the CTL epitope, or even a ten residue peptide. This significantly lessens the time and effort required todefine genes, and gene segments that contain CTL epitopes.',\n 'Methods for studying antiviral functions of macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes. Abstract Methods to check the antiviral activities of mononuclear phagocytes or macrophages are described. Two types of antiviral activities are defined. The intrinsic antiviral activity is determined as the outcome of virus replication in the macrophage per se whereas the extrinsic antiviral activity refers to the ability to reduce virus production in other surrounding cells that are normally permissive. The interpretation of the data are discussed.',\n \"A simplified procedure for studies of intestinal immunity in rabbits. Abstract As interest in the development of oral vaccines continues to rise, alternative animal models for studies of mucosal immunity are needed. The present study examines a simplified procedure for delivering antigen to rabbit Peyer's patches via an indwelling cannula. The cannula was placed 3–4 cm proximal to the Peyer's patch, and was used to deliver four weekly doses of the potent mucosal immunogen, cholera toxin (CT). Anti-CT specific fecal secretory IgA (S-IgA), serum IgG and serum IgA were found in essentially equal amounts in rabbits with cannulas and in rabbits fitted with Thiry-Vella (T-V) isolated ileal loops. In contrast to animals with T-V loops, the intestinal flora of animals with cannulas contained less bacterial overgrowth with Pseudomonas sp. Further, the villus architecture remained histologically normal in appearance and there were fewer post-surgical complications associated with this technique than with T-V loops. This simplified technique should allow wider use of rabbits in studies of mucosal immunity.\",\n 'Temporal events in the invasion of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, by a granulosis virus: An electron microscope study. Abstract The replication cycle of the granulosis virus of Cydia pomonella, the codling moth, was studied at the cellular and tissue level. Membranelike complexes were observed forming within the remnants of the nucleolus in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Differences in cell polarity relative to the sites of virus entry assembly and budding as well as differences in the temporal aspects of replication were observed between midgut, fat body, and epidermal cells. The progressive spread of virus throughout larval tissues was studied at 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 hr postinfection. The basal lamina seemed to be an effective barrier for the release of budded progeny virus into the hemocoel and large numbers of budded virus were produced.',\n 'Coronavirus glycoprotein E1, a new type of viral glycoprotein. Abstract The carbohydrate contents of coronavirus glycoproteins E1 and E2 have been analyzed. E2 has complex and mannose-rich-type oligosaccharide side-chains, which are attached by N-glycosidic linkages to the polypeptide. Glycosylation of E2 is initiated at the co-translational level, and it is inhibited by tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-glucose, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose. Thus, E2 belongs to a glycoprotein type found in many other enveloped viruses. E1, in contrast, represents a different class of glycoprotein. The following observations indicate that its carbohydrate side-chains have 0-glycosidic linkage. (1) The constituent sugars of E1 are N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and neuraminic acid; mannose and fucose are absent. (2) The side-chains can be removed by β-elimination. (3) Glycosylation of E1 is not sensitive to the compounds interfering with N-glycosylation. E1 is the first viral glycoprotein analyzed that contains only 0-glycosidic linkages. Coronaviruses are therefore a suitable model system to study biosynthesis and processing of this type of glycoprotein.',\n 'Structure of the black beetle virus genome and its functional implications. Abstract The black beetle virus (BBV) is an isometric insect virus whose genome consists of two messenger-active RNA molecules encapsidated in a single virion. The nucleotide sequence of BBV RNA1 (3105 bases) has been determined, and this, together with the sequence of BBV RNA2 (1399 bases) provides the complete primary structure of the BBV genome. The RNA1 sequence encompasses a 5′ non-coding region of 38 nucleotides, a coding region for a protein of predicted molecular weight 101,873 (protein A, implicated in viral RNA synthesis) and a 3′ proximal region encoding RNA3 (389 bases), a subgenomic messenger RNA made in infected cells but not encapsidated into virions. The RNA3 sequence starts 16 bases inside the coding region of protein A and contains two overlapping open reading frames for proteins of molecular weight 10,760 and 11,633, one of which is believed to be protein B, made in BBV-infected cells. A limited homology exists between the sequences of RNA1 and RNA2. Sequence regions have been identified that provide energetically favorable bonding between RNA2 and RNA1 possibly to facilitate their common encapsidation, and between RNA2 and negative strand RNA1 possibly to regulate the production of RNA3.',\n 'Evidence for a coiled-coil structure in the spike proteins of coronaviruses. Abstract The amino acid sequences of the spike proteins from three distantly related coronaviruses have been deduced from cDNA sequences. In the C-terminal half, an homology of about 30% was found, while there was no detectable sequence conservation in the N-terminal regions. Hydrophobic “heptad” repeat patterns indicated the presence of two α-helices with predicted lengths of 100 and 50 Å, respectively. It is suggested that, in the spike oligomer. these α-helices form a complex coiled-coil, resembling the supersecondary structures in two other elongated membrane proteins, the haemagglutinin of influenza virus and the variable surface glycoprotein of trypanosomes.',\n 'Conformation of an RNA pseudoknot. Abstract The structure of the 5′ GCGAUUUCUGACCGCUUUUUUGUCAG 3′ RNA oligonucleotide was investigated using biochemical and chemical probes and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Formation of a pseudoknot is indicated by the imino proton spectrum. Imino protons are observed consistent with formation of two helical stem regions; nuclear Overhauser enhancements between imino protons show that the two stem regions stack to form a continuous helix. In the stem regions, nucleotide conformations (3′-endo, anti) and internucleotide distances, derived from two-dimensional correlated, spectroscopy and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, are characteristic of A-form geometry. The data suggest minor distortion in helical stacking at the junctions of stems and loops. The model of the pseudoknot is consistent with the structure originally proposed by Pleij et al.',\n 'Amino acid substitution matrices from an information theoretic perspective. Abstract Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human α 1B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.',\n 'Mutational analysis of the RNA pseudoknot component of a coronavirus ribosomal frameshifting signal. Abstract The genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV contains an efficient ribosomal frameshift signal at the junction of the overlapping 1a and 1b open reading frames. The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.',\n 'Preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Abstract Crystals of the two ammo-terminal domains of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the receptor for the major group of human rhinovirus serotypes, diffract to 3.0 Å resolution. The crystals are trigonal in space group P3121 or P3221 with cell dimensions of a = b = 55.7 A ̊ , c = 166.3 A ̊ , with probably six molecules per unit cell.',\n 'Mutational analysis of the “slippery-sequence” component of a coronavirus ribosomal frameshifting signal. Abstract The ribosomal frameshift signal in the genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slippery-sequence” and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.',\n 'Intracisternal virus-like particles in brain of a multiple sclerosis patient. Abstract Doughnut-shaped particles, 55–65 nm in diameter, were revealed by electron microscopy in the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells from an active lesion in autopsied brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient. The morphology of the particles closely resembled that of coronaviruses.',\n 'Electron-microscopic appearance of the DA virus, a demyelinating murine virus. Abstract The DA virus is a neurotropic murine virus which can induce acute encephalomyelitis in suckling mice and a chronic myelopathy in weanlings. The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group. The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyelinative myelopathies in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.',\n 'Ultrastructural study of myelinating cells and sub-pial astrocytes in developing rat spinal cord. Abstract The anterior funiculus of the spinal cervical cord of post-natal rats was examined ultrastructurally. The myelinating cells found one day after birth contained a large amount of evenly distributed ribosomes up to the outer tongue of mesaxons, representing the cytoplasmic density. These cells were separated by astrocytic processes from the pial basement membrane, even when they were located on the pial surface. Astrocytes contained glial fibrils from one day onwards and often attached their processes to the pial basement membrane. Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes. The interpretation for this finding is discussed in relation to function and potency of the astrocytes, and variations and anomalies of nervous ontogeny.',\n 'Virus antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients detected with ELISA tests. Abstract The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine levels of specific IgG antibodies against measles, rubella, vaccinia, corona (OC43) and mumps viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 18 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS), 8 patients with optic neuritis (ON), 27 patients with other neurological disease (OND), and 88 control subjects without central nervous system disease. Serum antibody levels were not significantly different between the four groups. Differences in the frequency and levels of CSF antibodies between the four groups were observed. Control patients had serum CSF antibody ratios from 2.0 to 3.0 (log) with an average of 2.5 corresponding to a 320-fold difference between serum and CSF antibody levels. MS patients had ratios from 1.1 to 2.1 with an average of 1.6. The average was 2.0 for the ON patients. The average for the OND patients was similar to the controls. The altered serum CSF ratios for several viruses within an individual patient was similar. These results suggest that nonspecific immunostimulation is responsible for the increased levels of CSF virus antibodies.',\n 'Myelination by oligodendrocytes isolated from 4–6-week-old rat central nervous system and transplanted into newborn shiverer brain. Abstract Oligodendrocytes isolated from 4–6-week-old rat brains were transplanted into newborn shiverer brains. Cells were identified as mature oligodendrocytes both by immunocytological and ultrastructural criteria. Normal myelin was detected using immunolocalisation (with an anti-MBP antiserum) and electron microscopy (presence of the major dense line). Patches of normal myelin (made by transplanted oligodendrocytes), widely spread throughout the host brains, were detected between 20 and 130 days after grafting. No sign of acute rejection was observed, but the graft became progressively delimited by astrocytic processes forming a continuous basal lamina.',\n 'Studies on the mechanism of protection from acute viral encephalomyelitis by delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer T cell clones. Abstract Previous studies have shown that mice can be protected from a lethal infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) by the adoptive transfer of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-inducer T cell clones specific for the virus. Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.',\n 'Tumour necrosis factor causes an increase in axonal transport of protein and demyelination in the mouse optic nerve. Abstract An increase in fast axonal transport of protein by the optic nerve was found in mice following a single combined injection of human recombinant tumour necrosis factor alpha (rTNF) and [3H]proline into the vitreous chamber. Demyelination was observed in optic nerve fibres arising from the eyes of mice which received a single rTNF injection. No such changes were detected when heat-inactivated rTNF was injected with the label. The effects of intravitreal injection of rTNF on the pathophysiology of mouse optic nerve resembled those found in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We suggest that TNF could mediate at lease some of the pathophysiological changes found in SFV-infected mice and may provide a clue concerning the disease mechanism in multiple sclerosis.',\n \"The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis Additional considerations. Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is acquired as a systemic “trait” by individuals who are genetically susceptible. This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.\",\n 'Applications of coding theory to the design of somatic cell hybrid panels. Abstract The somatic cell hybridization technique for gene mapping depends on assembling panels of rodent-human hybrid clones containing random subsets of the human chromosomes. Such panels should be as informative as possible and permit error detection and error correction for assays of the human gene in the various clones. We derive estimates of the number of randomly generated clones required to be reasonably confident of accurately and unambiguously assigning a gene to a particular human chromosome. The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. These theoretical insights emphasize the need for more collaboration and coordination among gene mapping groups so that optimal clone panels can be assembled, stored, and distributed.',\n 'Recombination and gene conversion. Abstract Recombination is an important aspect of DNA metabolism. It leads to rearrangements of DNA sequences within genomes. Such genome rearrangements seem to be ubiquitous, since they play a role in evolution, human health and biotechnology. In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed. The need for considering recombinagenic effects as a safety aspect of chemicals has gained ground in the field of genetic toxicology. This paper summarizes present knowledge concerning the occurence, inducibility, detection and toxicological interpretation of DNA recombination.',\n 'Investigation of the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. Abstract This study examined the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18–39 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy controls. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment. Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects.',\n 'Central oxytocin increases food intake and daily weight gain in rats. Abstract The present study was performed to investigate the effects of centrally administered oxytocin on weight gain and food intake in rats. Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats (A and B) differing in average daily weight gain were used. Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 μg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 μl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 μg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A. These data suggest that oxytocin may act centrally to influence food intake and daily weight gain in slowly growing female Sprague-Dawley rats.',\n 'Canine coronavirus infection in the dog following oronasal inoculation. Abstract The pathogenesis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection in 10-week-old puppies was studied up to 14 days after oronasal inoculation. Mild diarrhoea was seen from three to 11 days after inoculation, approximately coincident with faecal virus shedding. Virus was initially isolated from the tonsils on day 3, and then from both small and large intestinal tissues up to 14 days after inoculation. Virus was also isolated from liver and lung. Histological changes were not seen in any tissues, but CCV antigen was detected, using a peroxidase antiperoxidase staining technique, mainly in epithelium overlying gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Virus neutralising antibody was first detected on day 10. Specific anti-CCV IgM was first detected in plasma three days after inoculation and IgG on days 4 to 7. Small amounts of anti-CCV IgG, IgM and IgA were detected in duodenal secretion, but none in bile.',\n 'Pathogenicity of concurrent infection of pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus and swine influenza virus. Abstract Combinations of porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv) and either of two swine influenza viruses (H1N1 or H3N2) were administered intranasally and by aerosol to six- to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs. The clinical responses, gross respiratory lesions and growth performances of these pigs were studied and compared with those of single (prcv, H1N1 or H3N2) and mock-infected animals. prcv infection caused fever, growth retardation and lung lesions, but no respiratory symptoms. Infection with swine influenza viruses caused rather similar, mild symptoms of disease, with H1N1 infection being the least severe. Combined infections with influenza viruses and prcv did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses. Furthermore, viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from ‘single’ than ‘dual’ infected animals, suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of prcv and swine influenza virus.',\n 'Evaluation of free or liposome-encapsulated ribavirin for antiviral therapy of experimentally induced feline infectious peritonitis. Abstract Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv). Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg−1) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip.',\n 'Viral antibodies in bovine fetuses in Argentina. Abstract In order to establish the prevalence of viral infections of the bovine fetus in Argentina, a serological survey for antibodies against viral agents currently affecting cattle in this country was conducted. Antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were investigated in a total of 315 fetal serum samples. Conventional techniques were used: indirect immunofluorescence (FMDV, BHV-1, BVDv and BCV), radial immunodiffusion (BLV), ELISA (BRV) and haemagglutination inhibition (PI-3). Antibodies against BHV-1, BVDV and PI-3 were detected in samples from fetuses in the second and third trimester of gestation, with a prevalence of 1·21 per cent (two of 165), 2·03 per cent (four of 197) and 5·08 per cent (nine of 177), respectively. Either antibodies or non-antibody factors able to bind to BRV and Bcv antigens were detected with a prevalence of 2·44 per cent (five of 205) and 4·54 per cent (five of 110), respectively. In addition, 14·68 per cent of non-specific inhibitors of PI-3 mediated haemagglutination were found. No seropositives against FMDV and BLV were detected.',\n 'Potential viral vectors for the stimulation of mucosal antibody responses against enteric viral antigens in pigs. Abstract Four viruses were compared for their ability to induce an intestinal antibody response in piglets. Antibodies were not detected in response to oral vaccination with either fowlpox virus or a baculovirus (BV). Simultaneous oral dosing and parenteral inoculation with high concentrations of BV in an oil emulsion adjuvant induced high levels of circulating virus neutralising (VN) antibodies, and also low levels of intestinal antibodies when booster doses of virus were given. In response to oral vaccination with swinepox virus (SPV), low levels of circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and higher titres of antibodies reactive in an enzyme immunoassay, including intestinal antibodies of the IgA class, were detected. Oral vaccination with porcine adenovirus type 3 (PAV-3) stimulated both circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and IgA antibodies were demonstrated in the intestinal contents. It was concluded that SPV and PAV-3 might be suitable vectors for the expression of genes encoding the protective antigens of porcine enteric viruses.',\n 'Interferon induction in swine lymphocyte antigen-defined miniature pigs. Abstract Interferon was induced in two groups of swine lymphocyte antigen (SLA)-defined miniature pigs with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose. The group 1 pigs were low antibody-response phenotypes (SLAa/a, SLAa/c, SLAc/c), and the group 2 pigs were high antibody-response phenotypes (SLAd/d, SLAd/g, SLAg/g). Six hours after induction the antiviral titres were not influenced by the SLA group, but higher titres were observed in females. Higher antiviral titres were found in group 2 pigs before treatment and 24 hours after treatment, and higher titres were found in female pigs. The antiviral titres before and after treatment were also influenced by the sire. Group 2 pigs had lower total leucocyte counts before treatment, and there was a significant reduction in leucocyte numbers in both groups six hours after induction, due mainly to a large reduction in lymphocyte counts.',\n 'Malnutrition and gastroenteritis in The Gambia. Abstract There is a strong association between failure to thrive and diarrhoeal disease in young Gambian children. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal disease seen is not due to frequent attacks of “acute infantile diarrhoea” of viral origin. The picture of protracted diarrhoea is almost certainly due to colonization of the upper bowel and the high prevalence demonstrated to be at least partly due to the environment to which the children are exposed, particularly in terms of food and water hygiene. Until this cycle of upper bowel colonization and protracted diarrhoea is broken, a diet-based nutrition programme cannot be expected to function effectively.',\n 'Inhibition in vivo of both infective Leishmania major and L. mexicana amazonensis mediated by a single monoclonal antibody. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies raised against a strain of Leishmania infantum isolated in Greece were produced and tested for their protective effect in an in vivo system (in BALB/C mice). A single monoclonal antibody, IgG2b isotype, can prevent the development of two Leishmania strains in vivo: one of L. major and one of L. mexicana amazonensis. This antibody-mediated protection may be dependent on complement.',\n 'Paediatric gastroenteritis in the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak: an epidemiological and clinical study. Abstract Over a period of 2 months, 35 of 69 (51%) cases of juvenile diarrhoea studied in eastern Malaysia were associated with rotavirus excretion; rotavirus associated diarrhoea occurred most commonly in the 6–24 month age group. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of genome ribonucleic acid showed that only 4 rotavirus electropherotypes could be detected. Of those, 2 predominated and 2 were detected only once each; one of these may have been a reassortaient of the two predominant electropherotypes. Analysis of the clinical features of patients excreting rotavirus subgroup 1 or 2, determined by PAGE, demonstrated that rotavirus subgroup 1 was associated with more hypotonic dehydration and need for intravenous therapy: lethargy was significantly more common among those excreting rotavirus subgroup 2.',\n 'Tropical sprue in southern India. Abstract Tropical sprue, a primary malabsorption syndrome affecting residents and visitors to several tropical regions, occurs in southern India in endemic and epidemic forms. The stomach, the small intestine and colon are affected and malabsorption results in nutrient deficiency. Enterocyte damage, the primary lesion in southern Indian tropical sprue, is the result of a persistent lesion of the stem cell compartment. This lesion occurs on a background of tropical enteropathy and the available evidence suggests that an immunity conferring agent may be responsible for initiating the damage.',\n 'Prevalence of enteric viruses among hospital patients with AIDS in Kinshasa, Zaire. Abstract Diarrhoea is the most common manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Africa. Numerous parasitic or bacterial agents have been implicated, but a pathogen-specific aetiology has not been found. Enteric viruses (i.e., rotavirus, small round structured viruses, coronavirus, and adenovirus) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electron microscopy in faecal specimens of 17% of 198 consecutive adult admissions to a general medical ward of an urban hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization Aids stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms. However, a trend (P = 0·14) towards greater frequency of virus in stools from patients in the lower 3 quintiles of the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was seen. This trend approached statistical significance (P = 0·07) with stratification by HIV infection. Although we found no evidence in this population to support a major pathogenic role for these viruses alone in the enteropathy of AIDS, increased viral shedding was weakly associated with immunodeficiency.',\n 'Halitunal, an unusual diterpene aldehyde from the marine alga Halimeda tuna. Abstract Halituna( 1 ), a novel diterpene aldehyde possessing a unique cyclopentadieno[c]pyran ring system, has been isolated from the marine alga Halimeda tuna. The structure of 1 was elucidated by spectroscopic techniques. Halitunal shows antiviral activity against murine coronavirus A59 in-vitro.',\n 'Synthesis of both enantiomers of halitunal. Abstract Both enantiomers of halitunal (1), a novel diterpene aldehyde having an iridoid carbon framework with a heteroaromatic 10π-system, have been synthesized from (+)-genipin (2).',\n 'Development of hepatic lesions in male Fischer-344 rats fed AIN-76A purified diet. Abstract The suitability of the AIN-76A diet for Fischer-344 rats was investigated. This diet, proposed by the American Institute of Nutrition for use when a purified diet composed of refined ingredients and added vitamins and minerals is required, was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male weanling Fischer-344 rats were fed three different lots of the AIN-76A diet from two suppliers. Increase in body weights and food consumption were compared to animals fed a cereal-based control diet. Animals were sacrificed at various intervals and tissues were taken for histopathological observation. By 8 weeks moderate to marked periportal lipidosis developed in livers of all rats fed the AIN-76A diet. Liver-body weight ratios over the 8-week period were significantly higher in rats fed AIN-76A diets compared to rats fed the control diet. However, growth rates of rats fed the AIN-76A diet were similar to growth rates of controls. Some rats fed the AIN-76A diet developed severe hemorrhagic lesions. The AIN-76A diet in its present form is not suitable for use with male Fischer-344 rats.',\n 'Effects of inhalation exposure to a high-boiling (288 to 454°C) coal liquid. Abstract Coal liquids have been evaluated in a variety of short-term toxicological assays; however, few studies have been conducted to determine the systemic effects after inhalation exposure to these materials. To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454°C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum. Results from this study indicated dose-dependent increases in the severity of the lesions observed, with few effects in the low-exposure group that were attributable to the exposure.',\n 'Effects of acute and chronic dimethylamine exposure on the nasal mucociliary apparatus of F-344 rats. Abstract Dimethylamine (DMA) is a highly water soluble gas with many industrial applications. Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.',\n 'In vitro evidence of cellular adaptation to ozone toxicity in the rat trachea. Abstract Adaptation to prolonged ozone (O3) exposure occurs in the tracheal epithelium of rats and is marked by the presence of ciliated cells with uniform short cilia but is not accompanied by shifts in cell populations, altered characteristics of epithelial secretory cell products, increased cell turnover, or elevated tracheal superoxide dismutase activity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.',\n 'Pretreatment with EDU decreases rat lung cellular responses to ozone. Abstract The phenylurea compound EDU (N-[2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolindinyl)ethyl]-N′-phenylurea) has been shown to protect plants from the damaging effects of ozone exposure. Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.',\n \"Lead, a major environmental pollutant, is immunomodulatory by its differential effects on CD4+ T cell subsets. Abstract Studies were undertaken to address the necessity of B-T cell contact for the enhancement of B cell differentiation caused by the heavy metal lead (Pb). Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement of B cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4+ T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self. In studies employing antigen-specific T cell clones, Pb was found to differentially modulate antigen presentation to TH1 versus TH2 T cell clones, in that TH1 activation was inhibited and TH2 activation was enhanced by Pb.\",\n 'Epithelial injury and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar regions of rats chronically exposed to a simulated pattern of urban ambient ozone. Abstract Electron microcopic morphometry was used to study the development of lung injury during and after chronic (78 weeks) exposure to a pattern of ozone (O3) designed to simulate high urban ambient concentrations that occur in some environments. The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.',\n 'Electron microscopic observations of visna virus-infected cell cultures. Abstract Electron microscopic observations of three cell lines infected with visna virus revealed two types of extracellular particles. The smaller of these was 65–110 mμ in diameter and contained a 20–30 mμ electron-dense core. Ordered arrays of the latter type of particle occurred rarely in the cytoplasm. After cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation of the virus, the band that contained maximal infectivity was composed of numerous particles with osmiophilic cores similar to those found in infected cell cultures. This finding suggests that such particles represent the infective agent. The second type of extracellular particle was larger (100–140 mμ in diameter), lacked an electron-dense core, and contained material similar in appearance to cellular cytoplasm. This form appeared to develop by budding from the cell surface.',\n 'Protein composition of coronavirus OC 43. Abstract A human coronavirus, strain OC 43, was propagated in suckling mouse brain and purified 5000-fold with, a 90% yield. Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s 0 20w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 ± 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW a ) was calculated to be 112 ± 5 × 106 daltons.',\n 'Aspects of the developmental morphology of california encephalitis virus in cultured vertebrate and arthropod cells and in mouse brain. Abstract An electron microscopic study was made of the replication of California encephalitis (La Crosse strain) in cultured vertebrate cells (Vero, African green monkey kidney), in a line of cultured mosquito cells (Aedes albopictus), and in brain tissue of suckling mice. Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide—a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells—and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell—of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50–60 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation. However, less than 10% of challenged mosquito cells became productively infected and for a proportion of these, at least as determined by electron microscopy, the infection was lethal.',\n 'Protein composition of tomato spotted wilt virus. Abstract Analysis of the protein composition of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), purified by an improved procedure, by polacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed three major structural proteins (of MW 84,000, 50,000, and 29,000d) and a minor one of MW 220,000d. The three major proteins constitute about 98% of the total viral protein and all three were shown to be glycoproteins. One of the major proteins (MW 29,000d) and the minor protein were shown to be associated with subviral particles isolated by treatment of virus with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. Only traces of the other two proteins were detected in the subviral particles. Synthesis of virus-induced proteins in TSWV-infected tobacco leaves was studied by labeling infected and healthy tissue with [3H]and [14C]valine, respectively. The labeled tissues were then fractionated into crude subcellular fractions and protein patterns of healthy and infected tissues were compared by coelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Only one virus-specific protein (of MW 49,000d) was detected in the virus-enriched fractions; this corresponded with the viral structural protein of MW 50,000d.',\n 'Purification and biophysical properties of human coronavirus 229E. Abstract Coronavirus 229E was grown to high titers in diploid fibroblast cells under medium containing twice the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins. Growth curves showed maximum virus production at multiplicities of infection of 0.1 and 1; maximum titers of intracellular virus occurred at 22–24 hr and of extracellular virus at 26 hr postadsorption. Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0–109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2–1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human “0” erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients. Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E 1cm 1% = 54.3 at 256 nm. The fully corrected sedimentation coefficient for the intact virion was S 20,v 0 = 381 S. PAGE by different techniques revealed seven polypeptides of mean apparent molecular weights between 16,900 and 196,100. Six contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Electropherograms of 3H- and 14C-labeled virus were identical to those of stained gels. Two glycoproteins constituting 25% of the virion protein were identified by bromelin digestion as the spike proteins. The density in sucrose and in potassium tartrate was 1.18 g/ml for the virion and 1.15 g/ml for the “despiked” particle.',\n 'The RNA of human coronavirus OC-43. Abstract A homogeneous RNA complex with a sedimentation coefficient of 70 S and an apparent molecular weight of approximately 6.1 × 106 was released from purified 32P-labeled, mouse-brain-derived OC-43 virus after treatment with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 15 min at 23°. The complex was highly susceptible to heat, releasing 4 S RNA fragments at 37° and breaking down to fragments of 4–70 S at 60°; it was also degraded by centrifugation through dimethyl sulfoxide gradients. Unlike tobacco mosaic virus or Rous sarcoma virus RNA, OC-43 RNA prepared by extraction with phenol-SDS or phenol-chloroform degraded into a range of fragments with coefficients of 15–55 S; 4 S RNA was also present as a minor component. This suggests that (a) extensive nicking of a large RNA molecule has occurred during viral growth, due to ribonucleases which are inactivated during phenol extractions; (b) heterogeneity for OC-43 RNA is not due to internal ribonuclease activity and fragments are held together by noncovalent linkages much weaker than those present in the 70 S retroviral RNA complex, or by small proteins; or, most probably, (c) a combination of extensive nicking and weak noncovalent linkages results in the heterogeneous denaturation products.',\n 'Characterization of a coronavirus I. Structural proteins: Effects of preparative conditions on the migration of protein in polyacrylamide gels. Abstract Coronavirus A59 possesses four size classes of structural proteins which have apparent molecular weights measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 23,000 (GP23), 50,000 (VP50), 90,000 (GP90), and 180,000 (GP180). VP50 is the only structural protein which is completely unaffected by protease treatment of intact virions. This species is the most highly labeled by polar amino acids such as glutamic acid and arginine and it is probably associated with the viral nucleocapsid. GP90, GP180, and GP23 are membrane-associated proteins. However, after protease treatment of virions, only 20% of the GP23 molecule is digested, whereas all of the GP90 and GP180 are removed. GP90 and GP180 appear to comprise most of the prominent layer of characteristic projections on the external surface of the viral envelope. The major portion of GP23 is presumed to lie within the lipid envelope, protected from protease digestion. GP23 and the protease resistant portion, p∗18, exhibit anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE. After heating to 100° in SDS the electrophoretic mobility of these polypeptides is altered and several new forms of lower mobility are produced. β-Mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol exaggerate the effects of heating.',\n 'Characterization of a coronavirus II. Glycoproteins of the viral envelope: Tryptic peptide analysis. Abstract Two species of membrane-associated glycoproteins have been identified in the coronavirus virion. They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins. The two envelope glycoproteins, GP23 and GP180/90 are designated E1 and E2, respectively; the inner core protein, VP50, is designated N.',\n 'Presence of infectious polyadenylated RNA in the coronavirus avian bronchitis virus. Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was radiolabeled for its nucleic acid component by growth in deembryonated chicken eggs. Purified virions of IBV have a buoyant density in linear sucrose gradients of 1.17-1.18 g/cm3 and contain approximately 4% RNA by weight. The genomic ribonucleic acid of IBV shows the following characteristic: (1) It consists of one size class of single-stranded RNA having a molecular weight of 5.5-5.7 x 108 and a sedimentation coefficient of about 48 S; (2) no evidence for subunit structure is apparent since the RNA resolves as a single species with the same electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels before and after heat denaturation; (3) at least 20–30% of the RNA molecules extracted from purified virions contain sequences of polyadenylic acid of approximately 4 S size; (4) RNA obtained from detergent-disrupted virus particles by phenol-chloroform extraction is infectious for cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts, giving rise to progeny virus which is lethal for embryonated eggs. These findings, together with the observation that IBV virions do not exhibit detectable transcriptase activity, support the conclusion that the genome of this coronavirus acts directly as a messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells.',\n 'Resolution of the major poliovirus capsid polypeptides into doublets. Abstract Using the pH gradient electrophoretic technique of Vrijsen and Boeyé, the coat protein of poliovirus types 1 and 2 was resolved into six components, Cl to C6, instead of the classical VP1-2-3 (the much smaller polypeptide VP4 was excluded from this study). The multiple components ran true upon reelectrophoresis, and there were no technical artifacts. Their resolution did not depend on a particular method for the preparation or disruption of the virion. The C1–C6 components of pH gradient electrophoresis and the classical VP1–VP3 polypeptides were examined with regard to (i) their migration in normal and pH gradient reelectrophoresis and (ii) their kinetics of leucine incorporation in emetine-stopped pulses. It is concluded that C1 and C2 were both derived from VPl, C3 and C4 from VP2, and C5 and C6 from VP3.',\n 'Intestinal influenza: Replication and characterization of influenza viruses in ducks. Abstract Influenza A viruses isolated from the cloaca of naturally infected feral ducks replicate in the lungs and in the cells lining the intestinal tract of feral and domestic ducks. Despite the low pH of the gizzard, the duck influenza viruses reach the intestines via the digestive tract and are found in high concentration in the feces. The viruses retain infectivity in fecal material for at least 30 days at 4° and for 7 days at 20°. The morphology of one strain of intestinal duck influenza virus (Hav7 Neg2) that had never been passed in embryonated eggs and was isolated from the feces was roughly spherical and fairly uniform in size and shape. However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0° and for 4 days at 22°. The susceptibility of ducks to infection with human and avian strains of influenza virus and the possibility of transmission to animal species through the water supply suggests that ducks may be important in the ecology of influenza viruses. The possibility of “intestinal influenza” virus vaccines is considered.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases II. Persistence and host-regulated thermosensitivity in cells of neural derivation infected with mouse hepatitis and measles viruses. Abstract Following inoculation of continuous cell lines of neural and other derivations, persistent infections are established with facility by mouse hepatitis and measles viruses. This occurs equally with the prototype MHV3 and its neurotropic variant JHM as well as with the Edmonston vaccine and SSPE Hallé measles variants. In almost every instance that the infection becomes persistent at 32.5°, virus replication is found to be thermosensitive at 39.5°; however, progeny virus derived from such infections at 32.5° is itself thermostable when replicating in the indicator, fully permissive cell lines. The new data, therefore, reveal the existence of a host-conferred interrelationship between persistence and virus restriction at elevated temperature. They indicate that the two agents with neurotropic potential, when they become established as pathogens in the nervous system, could be under close host cell regulation involving as yet unknown mechanisms.',\n 'Virus-induced diabetes mellitus. X. Attachment of encephalomyocarditis virus and permissiveness of cultured pancreatic β cells to infection. Abstract Monolayers of pancreatic β-cells from strains of mice susceptible (SJL/J) and resistant (C57BL/6J) to the development of virus-induced diabetes mellitus were inoculated with the M variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Immunofluorescence showed that viral antigens appeared in up to 10 times more β cells from susceptible SJL/J mice than from resistant C57BL/6J mice. Infectious center assays revealed that 10–30 times more SJL/J β cells contained infectious virus than C57BL/6J β cells. Viral attachment experiments showed no difference in the binding of EMC virus when embryonic fibroblasts, pancreatic fibroblasts, and kidney cells from SJL/J and C57BL/6J mice were compared. However, at least twice as much virus attached to the pancreatic β cells from susceptible than from resistant strains of mice. Our data suggest that genetically determined differences in viral receptors on the surface of β cells may be one of the factors controlling susceptibility to EMC-induced diabetes mellitus.',\n 'Pathogenic murine coronaviruses I. Characterization of biological behavior in vitro and virus-specific intracellular RNA of strongly neurotropic JHMV and weakly neurotropic A59V viruses. Abstract JHM virus (JHMV) and A59 virus (A59V) are neurotropic members of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae. JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5°. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40–100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose. Denaturation of the virus-specific RNA with heat and dimethylsulfoxide does not appreciably alter the sedimentation profiles of either the presumptive virion RNA or mRNA species.',\n 'Pathogenic murine coronaviruses II. Characterization of virus-specific proteins of murine coronaviruses JHMV and A59V. Abstract We have identified nine intracellular virus-specific proteins in cells infected with JHMV or A59V. Seven virus-specific proteins were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two additional virus-specific proteins were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The A59V- and JHMV-specific proteins differ slightly in molecular weight. Four of the nine proteins are structural proteins. The synthesis of the nine virus-specific proteins is noncoordinate with respect to time.',\n 'Pathogenic murine coronaviruses III. Biological and biochemical characterization of temperature sensitive mutants of JHMV. Abstract JHMV is a neurotropic member of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae. The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively. This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5° as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33°. N-Methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90–95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5°; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus ( 17 34 ), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34 ), and RNA-plus ( 3 34 ) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence. This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by “leakiness” or reversion. In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described.',\n 'Characterization of the cold-sensitive murine hepatitis virus mutants rescued from latently infected cells by cell fusion. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, was rescued from latently infected mouse neuroblastoma cells by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion to permissive cells. The isolated viruses grew to equal or higher titers than parental JHM virus at 39° but were restricted in replication at 32° and hence were cold-sensitive mutants. Neither isolate synthesized RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (32°), and temperature shift experiments indicated that the restrictive cold-sensitive step in replication occurred during an early viral function. The isolates were unable to complement each other at 32°. Although coinfection between each mutant and parental JHM virus often resulted in decreased yields of both infecting viruses, interference could not be convincingly demonstrated. Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population. Subclones of virus prepared from each isolate were also found to be thermally stable and to retain the cold sensitive defect. No indication of a second population of S-3JHM virus was detected.',\n 'The coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the cell nucleus and host transcriptional factors. Abstract Replication of avian infectious bronchitis virus in permissive BHK-21 cells is blocked when these cells are enucleated or irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to infection, or if cells are treated with α-amanitin during the virus growth cycle. This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of α-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections. Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.',\n 'Effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus. Abstract The infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was moderately affected by iodoacetic acid and drastically affected by N-ethylmaleimide; the antiviral effect of these sulfhydryl reagents was enhanced somewhat by the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Reducing and/or alkylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [14C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents.',\n 'The replication of murine coronaviruses in enucleated cells. Abstract Coronaviruses JHMV and A59V have been shown to replicate, produce viral-specific antigens and cytopathic effects (CPE) in enucleated 17CL-1 cells.',\n 'RNA and polypeptide homology among murine coronaviruses. Abstract Using a 32P complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared against the A59 nucleocapsid protein messenger RNA, we have investigated the extent of homology between A59 and four other strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70–80% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virology, 112, 596–604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEI polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35Sknethionine-labeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromotography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV-3, JHM, and A59.',\n 'Tunicamycin resistant glycosylation of a coronavirus glycoprotein: Demonstration of a novel type of viral glycoprotein. Abstract Tunicamycin has different effects on the glycosylation of the two envelope glycoproteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus. Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.',\n 'Role of protease in mouse hepatitis virus-induced cell fusion Studies with a cold-sensitive mutant isolated from a persistent infection. Abstract A plaque mutant was isolated from Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/c cells persistently infected with a mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-S. While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques. Protease appears to play an important role in MHV-induced cell fusion in general.',\n 'The virus-specific intracellular RNA species of two murine coronaviruses: MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Abstract Seven virus-specific, polyadenylated RNA species have been identified in mouse cells infected with the murine coronaviruses MHV-A59 (A59V) or MHV-JHM (JHMV). MHV-infected 17CL·1 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of actinomycin D and the cytoplasmic RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. These RNA species range in size from 6.3 × 105 to 6.1 × 106 daltons. The A59V and JHMV-specific RNAs have identical molecular weights and comigrate in agarose gels. The largest intracellular RNA species is identical to RNA isolated from purified virions, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and oligonucleotide fingerprint studies of ribonuclease T1 digests. Oligonucleotide fingerprints of the six subgenomic RNAS show that the sequences they contain are present in virion RNA, confirming their virus-specific nature. The fingerprinting studies also demonstrate that the six subgenomic RNA species make up a nested set. The sequences present in each RNA species are also present in all larger RNA species. These larger RNAs also contain additional sequences consistent with their greater size. The subgenomic RNAs fulfull many of the criteria for mRNAs. Possible mechanisms for generating these RNAs are discussed.',\n 'Intracellular murine hepatitis virus-specific RNAs contain common sequences. Abstract A major polyadenylated viral RNA of approximately 0.8 × 106 daltons was isolated from murine hepatitis virus (A59)-infected cells by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in formamide. This RNA was shown to encode the viral nucleocapsid protein by direct in vitro translation in a cell-free, reticulocyte-derived system. Single stranded 32P-labeled complementary DNA was prepared from this RNA and was demonstrated to be virus specific. Using this complementary DNA in a Northern blotting procedure, we were able to identify six major virus-specific intracellular RNA species with estimated molecular weights of 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 3, and 4 × 106 daltons. All of these RNA species were polyadenylated. Our results support the idea that coronavirus-infected cells contain multiple intracellular polyadenylated RNAs which share common sequences.',\n 'Isolation and identification of virus-specific mRNAs in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Abstract We have determined the kinetics of virus production and virus-specific RNA synthesis in Sac(−) cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 × 106 (RNA1), 4.0 × 106 (RNA2), 3.0 × 106 (RNA3), 1.4 × 106 (RNA4), 1.2 × 106 (RNA5), 0.9 × 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 × 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1 × 106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs. The position of these homologous regions and the translation products of each of the mRNAs remain to be determined.',\n 'Cell tropism and expression of mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) in mouse spinal cord cultures. Abstract Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) are coronaviruses which cause various infections in mice affecting lung, intestine, liver, and other organs as well as the central nervous system. The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies to murine hepatitis virus-4 (strain JHM) define the viral glycoprotein responsible for attachment and cell-cell fusion. Abstract Hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies to the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus-4 (MHV-4) were established. By indirect immunofluorescence and immune precipitation, monoclonal antibodies of three viral polypeptide specificities were characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to nucleocapsid reacted in the cytoplasm of infected cells and precipitated the 60,000d nucleocapsid polypeptide (VP-4) of MHV-4. Other monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and were found to precipitate the 170,000d viral glycoprotein (GP-1). A third set of monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and precipitated the 25,000d viral glycoprotein (GP-5) and its precursor VP-6 (23,000d). AntiGP-1 alone had direct neutralizing activity for MHV-4 virus, while in the presence of complement both anti-GP-1 and anti-GP-5 neutralized virus. Only anti-GP-1 had the ability to inhibit the spread of infection due to fusion in L241 cells. Thus, the viral glycoprotein GP-1 likely contains both the attachment and fusion activities of MHV-4.',\n 'Equine arteritis virus-infected cells contain six polyadenylated virus-specific RNAs. Abstract The kinetics of equine arteritis virus growth and virus-specific RNA synthesis at 40° were determined in BHK-21 cells. Maximum titers of infectious virus (∼107 PFU/ml) were observed at 12 hr p.i., while incorporation of [3H]uridine into virus-specific RNA became detectable at 4 hr p.i. and increased to reach a maximum rate at 8 hr p.i. This RNA was labeled between 2.5 and 7 hr p.i. and isolated from infected cells. About 44% bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-urea gel. Six virus-specific RNA species were found having the following molecular weights: 4.3 × 106 (RNA1), 1.3 × 106 (RNA2), 0.9 × 106 (RNA3), 0.7 × 106 (RNA4), 0.3 × 106 (RNA5), and 0.2 × 106 (RNA6). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. Subsequently, the target sizes of the templates for the synthesis of the genome-sized RNA and the five subgenomic RNAs were determined by uv transcription mapping. Infected cells were irradiated at 6.5 hr p.i. The effect o of reasing uv doses on the RNA synthesis was determined by quantitation of the individual RNAs after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The uv target sizes calculated for the templates for RNAs 2–5 were very close to the physical size of RNA1. The target size of the template of RNA6 was smaller (2.8 × 106 daltons), although much greater than its physical size. The data are consistent with a model in which the individual RNAs are derived from a larger precursor RNA molecule. The consequences of these findings for the taxonomy of Togaviridae are discussed.',\n 'Acylation of virol. spike glycoproteins: A feature of enveloped RNA viruses. Abstract The covalent attachment of fatty acids to the glycoproteins of orthomyxo-, paramyxo, alpha-, and coronavirus was studied. All enveloped viruses analyzed afford covalently bound fatty acid in at least one species of their spike glycoproteins. No internal components of the viruses studied including the hydrophobic M proteins of myxo- and rhabdoviruses contained fatty acid. Analysis of myxovirus particles devoid of the exposed portions of their spikes revealed that fatty acids are linked to the hydrophobic tail fragment of the glycoprotein which is associated with the viral lipid bilayer. With influenza virus hemagglutinin the fatty acid attachment site could be located at the cyanogen bromide peptide of the small subunit (HA2) which contains the membrane-embedded region of the polypeptide. The binding of fatty acids to viral glycoproteins occurs in a wide range of host cells including mammalian, avian, and insect cells.',\n 'Synthesis and subcellular localization of the murine coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Abstract The synthesis and processing of the nucleocapsid protein (pp60) of the JHM strain of murine coronaviruses were examined. Pulse-chase experiments showed that pp60 was synthesized initially as a protein of approximately 57,000 in molecular weight (p57). Immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-JHMV antiserum indicated that p57 was virus specific. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies specific for pp60 showed that p57 was antigenically related to pp60 and was not phosphorylated, while the intracellular protein that comigrated with the virion nucleocapsid protein, pp60, was phosphorylated. The p57 was found exclusively in the cytosol while the majority of pp60 was associated with the membrane fraction but pp60 was not an integral membrane protein.',\n 'Characterization of a cold-sensitive (cs) recombinant between two influenza a strains. Abstract Recombinants between fowl plague virus (FPV, H7N1) and the Hong Kong (H3N2) or Singapore (H2N2) influenza virus strains carrying the hemagglutinin of FPV and the neuraminidase of the human strains form only very tiny plaques at 33°, but normal plaques at 37°. One recombinant (113/Ho) has been studied in more detail. It multiplies only very slowly at 33°, the nonpermissive temperature. Adsorption and penetration are normal at 33°, but synthesis of protein is impeded. Temperature-shift experiments suggest that the synthesis of viral mRNA is slowed at 33°. 113/Ho does not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 40°, as the parent viruses do. 113/Ho can be adapted to grow normally at 33°. The frequency of adaptation is comparable to reversion of a single point mutation (ca. 10−5). Recombinants which grow well at 37° but not at 33° are called cold-sensitive (cs) recombinants.',\n 'High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of structural proteins of baculoviruses of Autographa californica and Porthetria (lymantria) dispar. Abstract The structural polypeptides of baculoviruses of Autographa californica (AcMNPV) and Porthetria dispar (PdMNPV) were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Purified proteins were solubilized in urea-NP40 mix and separated by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension; electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) separated proteins by molecular weight in the second dimension. Eighty-one acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 86,000 Da were resolved in AcMNPV enveloped virions. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 41,500 and was considered to be the major capsid protein. Nucleocapsids from AcMNPV were resolved into 64 polypeptides. At least 11 of the polypeptides, including most of the high molecular weight proteins, that were not resolved in nucleocapsids were considered to be envelope proteins. For PdMNPV enveloped virions, there were 95 acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 85,500. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 46,500 Da. Polyhedral proteins (polyhedrin) isolated from protease-inactivated polyhedra and separable into a single major polypeptide (approx. 31,000) on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were resolved into six polypeptides for both viruses. All six polyhedrin polypeptides had the same molecular weight, but their isoelectric points ranged from pH 5.3 to 5.9 for AcMNPV and from pH 5.7 to 6.2 for PdMNPV. These six polypeptides were also detected when protease-inactivated or noninactivated whole polyhedra were analyzed directly by 2-D electrophoresis. It is assumed that not all the observed baculovirus polypeptides were unique species. Some proteins, especially the polyhedrin polypeptides, appeared to be related and had altered mobilities as a consequence of post-translational modifications.',\n 'Temperature-sensitive mutants of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59: Isolation, characterization and neuropathogenic properties. Abstract Twenty 5-fluorouracil-induced temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 were isolated from 1284 virus clones. Mutants were preselected on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia in infected cells at the restrictive temperature (40°) vs the permissive temperature (31°). Of these mutants, only those with a relative plating efficiency 40° 31° of 3 × 10−3 or smaller were kept. Virus yields at 40° compared to 37° and 31° (leakiness) were determined. Most mutants (16) were RNA−, i.e., unable to synthesize virus-specific RNA at the restrictive temperature. The other four were RNA+. No qualitative differences were detected in the virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with RNA+ ts-mutants, both at 31° and 40°. Virus-specific proteins present in cells infected with is-171 (RNA−) and the RNA+-mutants (ts-43, is-201, is-209, and is-279) were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. No qualitative differences in the pattern of virus-specific cellular proteins were detected among the mutants except for an additional polypeptide of about 46,000 daltons in ts-209-infected cells. Finally, the neuropathogenic properties of eight of the mutants were investigated. Whereas 102 PFU of wild-type virus injected intracerebrally killed 50 to 100% of 4-week-old Balc/c mice within 1 week, the mutants were highly attenuated. A dose of 105 PFU lead to no or transient disease. However, 4 weeks after infection with ts 342, is-43, or is-201 obvious histological changes were observed in brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy mice.',\n 'Fusion resistance and decreased infectability as major host cell determinants of coronavirus persistence. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus persists in cultures of a subline (designated LM-K) of mouse LM cells but produces a lytic infection in L-2 cells. Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.',\n 'Antigenic relationships of murine coronaviruses: Analysis using monoclonal antibodies to JHM (MHV-4) virus. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies were produced to JHMV-DL, a neurotropic member of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or murine coronavirus group. Of 23 antibodies isolated, 10 were specific for the major envelope glycoprotein, gp180/90, 10 for the nucleocapsid protein, pp60, and 3 for the minor envelope glycoprotein, gp25. Eleven different MHV isolates were used in antibody binding assays to study antigenic relationships among the viruses. Each MHV isolate tested had a unique pattern of antibody binding, indicating that each is a distinct strain. Conservation of JHMV-DL antigenic determinants varied among the three proteins, with pp60 showing intermediate conservation, gp180/90 little conservation, and gp25 marked conservation in the different MHV strains. Monoclonal antibodies to pp60 proved most useful in delineating antigenic relationships among MHV strains. These antigenic groups correlated with pathogenic types, indicating that pp60 may be one of the gene products which mediates the distinct disease patterns manifested by different murine coronaviruses.',\n 'A study of the glycoproteins of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). Abstract Pulse labeling with tritiated mannose was used to follow the time course of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) glycoprotein synthesis in Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-21 cells. Nine viral-induced intracellular glycoproteins were first detected from as early as 2 hr postinoculation (67K, early phase) to as late as 14 hr (36K and 19K glycoproteins, intermediate phase). Glycosylation of these proteins was observed to continue to the end of the experiment (28 hr postinoculation). Seven of these intracellular glycoproteins could also be detected in infected Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells 24 hr postinoculation. When the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was present (from 0 hr postinoculation) there was no detectable glycosylation of any of these viral-induced glycoproteins. Metabolic labeling of the nonoccluded virus budded from IPLB-21 and TN-368 with tritiated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine identified 11 structural glycoproteins, 8 of which were identical in both virus preparations. All of these structural glycoproteins were sensitive to the inhibitory action of tunicamycin. A single 42K structural glycoprotein was detected (with acetylglucosamine only) in the occluded form of AcNPV. Glycosylation of this structural protein appeared to be insensitive to tunicamycin. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination was used to determine which of the virus structural glycoproteins are exposed on the virion surface.',\n 'Topographical mapping of epitopes on the glycoproteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 (strain JHM): Correlation with biological activities. Abstract Monoclonal hybridoma antibodies (MAb) of defined polypeptide specificity and biological activity were used in a competition binding assay to identify antibody binding sites (epitopes) on the glycoproteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 strain JHM (MHV-4). Individual MAb were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and used as probes in a competition enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Four topographically distinct antigenic sites were detected on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4. Antibodies reacting with these four determinants provisionally designated A(E2), B(E2), C(E2), and D(E2) had corresponding biological activities (M. J. Buchmeier, H. A. Lewicki, P. J. Talbot, and R. L. Knobler (1984) Virology 132, 261–270). Antibodies to sites A(E2) and B(E2) mediated virus neutralization in vitro and passively protected mice against lethal virus challenge in vivo. Antibody to site C(E2) neutralized virus efficiently in vitro but did not alter disease in vivo, while antibody to site D(E2) neither neutralized nor protected. Two major nonoverlapping antigenic sites were defined on the El glycoprotein. Overlapping epitopes A(El) and B(El) constituted one site and epitope C(E1) the other.',\n 'Murine hepatitis virus-4 (strain JHM)-induced neurologic disease is modulated in Vivo by monoclonal antibody. Abstract Monoclonal hybridoma antibodies directed against the polypeptides of murine hepatitis virus-4 (JHM strain) were tested for their ability to alter the course of a normally lethal intracerebral virus challenge. Three monoclonal antibodies directed against two distinct epitopes on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4 protected mice against lethal virus challenge and converted the infection from fatal encephalomyelitis to demyelination. A single neutralizing antibody directed against a third epitope on E2 as well as seven nonneutralizing antibodies to E2, E1, and N polypeptides did not protect against challenge. In mice which received protective antibody, MHV-4 infection was not blocked, however, virus grew to lower titers in liver and brain, and virus replication in the CNS was more restricted than in unprotected mice. Decreased involvement of neurons in the brains of protected mice was observed, and no evidence of neuronal infection in the spinal cords was found. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were infected in the presence of protective antibody, and evidence of demylination associated with mononuclear cell infiltration was found. These studies demonstrate that antibody to a single epitope on a viral glycoprotein can substantially alter the course and phenotype of disease.',\n 'Reversible restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus in permissive cells treated with inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Abstract Indomethacin, a potent nonsteroidal inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase) reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells more than 99% if added to cultures at levels of 10−3 M either before or after infection. Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (α-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10−4 M to one of 10−9 M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of VSV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.',\n \"Characterization of murine hepatitis virus (JHM) RNA from rats with experimental encephalomyelitis. Abstract When Wistar Furth rats are inoculated intracerebrally with the murine hepatitis virus JHM they often develop a demyelinating disease with resulting hind leg paralysis. Using an RNA transfer procedure and hybridization kinetic analysis, the virus-specific RNA in these rats was characterized. The pattern of JHM-specific RNA varied with individual infections of Wistar Furth rats. However, two species of JHM-specific RNA, the nucleocapsid and a 2.1–2.4 × 106-Da RNA species were generally present. A general decrease in JHM-specific RNA in brains' and spinal cord samples taken later than 20 days postinoculation was observed; however, JHM-specific RNA persisted in the spinal cord longer than in the brain of these rats.\",\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating disease IX. Progression of JHM virus infection in the central nervous system of the rat during overt and asymptomatic phases. Abstract JHM virus, when inoculated into neonatal rats, can cause either a rapidly fatal acute encephalomyelitis or, after longer incubation periods, a paralytic disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.',\n 'Physical mapping of human cytomegalovirus genes: Identification of DNA sequences coding for a virion phosphoprotein of 71 kDa and a viral 65-kDa polypeptide. Abstract Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from fibroblast cultures infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain AD169 during the late phase of viral replication. The RNA was selected by hybridization to a series of cosmid clones containing the entire viral genome in partially overlapping segments. Translation of this RNA in a reticulocyte cell-free system allowed the mapping of virus specific polypeptides. Nine polypeptides synthesized in vitro comigrated with major virion structural proteins. An in vitro-translated protein of 71 kDa was precipitated by a monoclonal antibody directed against the phosphorylated internal envelope protein of 71 kDa. The map coordinates of viral DNA coding for this phosphoprotein were localized by hybrid selection with subcloned DNA fragments, and the direction of transcription was determined by hybrid selection with single-stranded DNA cloned in bacteriophage vector M13mp9. An in vitro translation with size-fractionated RNA, combined with immunoprecipitation and Northern blot analyses, indicated that an mRNA of 4 kb encodes the 71-kDa phosphoprotein. An mRNA of the same size, map coordinates, and orientation was translated into an abundant 65-kDa polypeptide which had the same size as the major structural phosphoprotein of HCMV.',\n 'Replication of murine coronaviruses in somatic cell hybrids between murine fibroblasts and rat Schwannoma cells. Abstract The replication of the murine coronaviruses MHV3 and JHM has been studied in somatic cell hybrids formed between murine fibroblast L2 cells which support lytic infections with both these agents, and rat RN2 Schwannoma cells which support the replication of JHM in a temperature-sensitive, persistent manner but are restrictive to the replication of MHV3. The results described in this report indicate that the totally permissive state is dominant over the persistent or restricted state since the hybrid cells permit the replication of both these viral agents in a lytic manner.',\n 'Analysis of genomic and intracellular viral RNAs of small plaque mutants of mouse hepatitis virus, JHM strain. Abstract The genomic RNA and intracellular RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) and two plaque mutants (la and 2c), which have been isolated from a persistently infected culture (JHM-CC), have been analyzed by T1-resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing. The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), Virology 114, 39–51), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3′ coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5′ direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized.',\n 'Budded Autographa californica NPV 64K protein: Further biochemical analysis and effects of postimmunoprecipitation sample preparation conditions. Abstract Previously it was shown that AcV1, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the Autographs californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus-budded phenotype reacted with a surface antigen present on infected cells during virus budding, and in the viral envelope (L. E. Volkman, P. A. Goldsmith, R. T. Hess, and P. Faulkner (1984), Virology 133, 354–362). Radioimmune precipitation of solubilized, [35S]methionine-labeled budded virus with AcV1 and analysis on SDS-PAGE revealed four bands consistently: one major band at 64,000 Da, and three minor bands at 127,000, 59,000, and 49,000 Da. The reason for the appearance of four bands instead of one was unclear. Data suggest that two of the bands, 49K and 59K, are aberrant, and are the products of sample preparation conditions. Further, evidence is presented that the 127K band is composed of dimers of the 64K protein, and that under nonreducing conditions, oligomers (trimers and tetramers) of 64K protein can also be detected. BVGP 64 is additionally shown to be phosphorylated and to have an isoelectric point of 3.15. The BVGP 64 epitope reactive with AcV1 is destroyed by interaction with SDS. This could account for the lack of neutralizing activity of antiserum made to the SDS-PAGE purified BVGP 64.',\n 'Neutralization of budded Autographa californica NPV by a monoclonal antibody: Identification of the target antigen. Abstract A neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the budded phenotype of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrons virus did not react with the occluded form of the virus as determined by neutralization, ELISA, and indirect immunoperoxidase staining. The antibody did react with the surface of infected cells in the prepolyhedra stage of cytopathic effect, the period of active virus budding. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated the antigen(s) reactive with the neutralizing antibody was present all around the viral envelope, but was more highly concentrated at the end with peplomers. Four proteins were immunoprecipitated from solubilized, radiolabeled budded virus preparations with the monoclonal antibody. The major protein had a molecular weight of approximately 64,000, while the other three were approximately 127,000, 59,000, and 49,000. All four proteins could be labeled with N-acetyl-d-[1-3H]glucosamine. This glycosylation reaction could be inhibited by tunicamycin.',\n 'Defective interfering particles of mouse hepatitis virus. Abstract After six to eight serial undiluted passages of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM strain) in DBT cell culture, a decrease in the yield of infectious virus occurred, and with further passages fluctuating yields of infectious virus were observed. The serially passaged virus interfered with the multiplication of the standard JHM virus, but not with vesicular stomatitis virus. After sucrose equilibrium centrifugation of high passage virus, a single peak contained both infectious virus and interfering activity. This virus population resembled the original JHM virus in its structural proteins, but it contained an increased proportion of a protein with a molecular weight of 65 × 103. Genomic RNA from standard JHM virus contained a single species of RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 × 106. After five undiluted passages, however, the virion population contained two RNA species with molecular weights of 5.4 × 106 and 5.2 × 106. RNase T1 resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing of these RNAs showed that the lower molecular weight RNA had lost several oligonucleotide spots that were present in the genomic RNA of the standard JHM virus. After several serial diluted passages of passage 10 virus, a single virus population was obtained which again had only standard virus RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 × 106 and lacked interfering activity. These results indicated that defective interfering particles were generated by serial undiluted passages of JHM virus.',\n 'Further characterization of mouse hepatitis virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Abstract Two temporally and enzymatically distinct RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities associated with membranes of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells have been identified previously [Brayton et al., J. Virol. 42, 847–853 (1982)]. In this paper, the subcellular distribution and functions of these two polymerases were examined. Fractionation of the postnuclear membranes by sucrose gradient sedimentation showed that the early polymerase activity (detected at 1 hr p.i.) was homogeneous, while the late polymeras e (6 hr p.i.) was associated with two distinct membrane fractions. The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex. They also establish the essential features of the mode of replication of MHV.',\n 'Effect of tunicamycin and monensin on biosynthesis, transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 glycoproteins. Abstract The effect of tunicamycin and monensin on the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins was examined. Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.',\n 'Identification and characterization of a mouse mammary tumor virus protein uniquely expressed on the surface of BALB/cV mammary tumor cells. Abstract A unique subline of BALB/c mice, designated BALB/cV, exhibits an intermediate mammary tumor incidence (47%) and harbors a distinct milk-transmitted mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The BALB/cV subline was used to study the molecular basis of potential virus-host interactions involving cell surface-expressed MMTV proteins. Cell surface iodination identified virus-specific proteins expressed on BALB/cv primary mammary tumor cells grown in culture. In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein. The 68K env protein was also detected on the surface of metabolically labeled BALB/cV tumor cells by an external immunoprecipitation technique. The expression of 68K env was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins. Biochemical analysis established that 68K env was not modified by N-linked glycosylation. 125I-labeled 68K env was rapidly released into the media of tumor cell cultures and was recovered both in the form of a soluble protein and in a 100,000 g pellet. The biologic function of this cell surface-expressed viral protein remains unknown.',\n 'Processing of virus-specific glycoproteins of varicella zoster virus. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoproteins were used to study the processing of three glycoproteins with molecular weights of 83K–94K (gp 2), 64K (gp 3), and 55K (gp 5). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with VZV-infected cells, pulse labeled with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of tunicamycin, suggest that O-linked oligosaccharide is present on the glycoprotein of gp 2. Use of the enzyme endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H revealed that the fully processed form of gp 3 had high-mannose type and that of gp 5 had only complex type of N-linked oligosaccharides. Experiments with monensin suggest that the precursor form (116K) of gp 3 is cleaved during the processing from Golgi apparatus to cell surface membrane. The extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chain and the complex type of N-linked oligosaccharide chains also occurs during this processing.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating disease of coronaviruses in primary explants of the rat CNS XI. Tropism and differentiation regulate the infectious process of coronaviruses in primary explants of the rat CNS. Abstract The coronaviruses, ubiquitous in mammals, including man, manifest serotype-related predeliction for different tissues. This presentation deals with specificity of the murine viscerotropic MHV3 and neurotropic JHMV for explanted cells from the CNS of newborn, inbred, Wistar-Furth rats. An unambiguous tropism of MHV3 for astrocytes and JHMV for oligodendrocytes is demonstrated. With the latter cell-virus interaction, relatively small differences in spatial density of oligodendrocytes influence profoundly the duration of persistence and virus yield. The in vitro temporal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation, monitored by induction of a myelin-related enzyme, 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase, corresponds to that occurring in vivo (F. A. McMorris, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515, 1983). It is complete within 15–21 days and is coincident with the onset of insusceptibility to disease caused by JHMV. Experimental elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP levels, presumed to reflect oligodendrocyte differentiation, likewise suppresses JHMV replication without affecting that of MHV3 in astrocytes. On the basis of these data it is concluded that in vitro interaction of JHMV with oligodendrocytes reflects accurately the in vivo host control over the tropism and expression of this virus, thereby effecting the progressive, demyelinative disease, process.',\n 'Characterization and localization of CIV polypeptides. Abstract In order to detect the structural proteins linked with disulfide bonds, CIV was solubilized and electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions in the first dimension and then under reducing conditions in the second dimension. The viral polypeptides linked originally with disulfide bonds were separated into subunits. The complexes were trimers (P′50) or dimers (P60 and P10). The apparent molecular weights of P81, P53, and P49 changed significantly according to the composition of the lysis buffer used, suggesting that the differences in their molecular weights were due to conformational changes produced by reduction of their intramolecular disulfide bonds. Sulfhydryl-containing polypeptides (P′50-P50, P60, P100, and P33) were detected by N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, and the accessibility of these residues was analyzed after successive stripping of the CIV particle. Radioiodination of external polypeptides by [125I]iodosulfanilic acid shows only one intensively labeled spot corresponding to the P50 polypeptide, whereas P′50 was only slightly labeled. Six viral polypeptides P81, P60, P31, P17, P13, and P10 were revealed to possess high affinity for CIV DNA. A structural model of CIV is proposed and discussed.',\n 'Difference in sensitivity to interferon among mouse hepatitis viruses with high and low virulence for mice. Abstract Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) of different virulence for mice were studied with respect to interferon (IFN) sensitivity. The growth of low-virulent MHV-S and intermediately virulent MHV-JHM was significantly suppressed in IFN-treated L cells compared with untreated cells. However, a comparable suppression of the growth of highly virulent MHV-2 was not observed in IFN-treated cells. This differential effect of IFN treatment could also be demonstrated at the level of viral mRNA and viral proteins. In cells infected with MHV-S or MHV-JHM the amount of viral mRNAs was remarkably reduced by IFN treatment. Also the levels of the major intracellular viral proteins, in particular the E, protein, were affected by IFN treatment. Similar effects could not be demonstrated in MHV-2-infected cells. These results suggest that during MHV-S or MHV-JHM infection IFN treatment suppresses virus replication at several stages. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the pathogenecity of these viruses.',\n 'Modification of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen by glycosylation. Abstract The SV40-encoded transforming protein, large tumor antigen (T-ag), is multifunctional. Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.',\n 'Attenuation of murine coronavirus infection by ammonium chloride. Abstract Ammonium chloride at a concentration of 20 mM delayed by 4–5 hr the production of virus progeny in mouse L-2 cells infected at high multiplicity with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases XV. Differentiation influences the regulation of coronavirus infection in primary explants of mouse CNS. Abstract Mouse oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, in primary cerebral explant cultures, were infected with JHMV and MHV3 coronaviruses. Contrary to previous findings with neural cells from the rat (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, 1985, Virology 141, 89–101), these agents show no discrimination in the tropism and have the ability to replicate in either type of murine glial cell. Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A. McMorris,1983, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515). After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that susceptibility of rodents to CNS infection by coronaviruses is determined, in part, by the age-related maturation process of oligodendrocytes.',\n 'The effect of loss of regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis on sindbis virus replication. Abstract During the replication cycle of Sindbis virus minus-strand synthesis stops normally at the time that plus-strand synthesis reaches a maximum rate. We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40° but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40° but not at 30° and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus nucleocapsid protein gene. Abstract The 3′ end of the 20-kb genome of the Purdue strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was copied into eDNA after priming with oligo(dT) and the double-stranded product was cloned into the PstI site of the pUC9 vector. One clone of 2.0-kb contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in its entirety using the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert. Another clone of 0.7 kb also contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in part to confirm the primary structure of the most 3′ end of the genome. Two potential, nonoverlapping genes were identified within the 3′-terminal 1663-base sequence from an examination of open reading frames. The first gene encodes a 382-amino acid protein of 43,426 mol wt, that is the apparent nucleocapsid protein on the basis of size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. It is flanked on its 5′ side by at least part of the matrix protein gene. The second encodes a hypothetical 78-amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt that is hydrophobic at both ends. A 3′-proximal noncoding sequence of 276 bases was also determined and a conserved stretch of 9 nucleotides near the poly(A) tail was found to be common among TGEV, the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus.',\n 'Characterization of a variant virus isolated from neural cell culture after infection of mouse coronavirus JHMV. Abstract Our previous experiments showed that a variant virus with a larger envelope glycoprotein encoded by a larger mRNA3 (cl-2) multiplied predominantly in the brain of rats after wild type (wt) JHMV infection (F. Taguchi, S. Siddell, H. Wege, and V. ter Meulen, 1985, J. Virol., 54, 429–435). We could isolate similar but not identical variant virus after infection of cultured neural cells from rat brain with wt JHMV (designated CNS virus), which also had a larger mRNA3 and produced larger envelope E2 glycoprotein in infected cells. CNS virus multiplied to a higher degree in cultured astrocytes from rat than wt JHMV and cl-2. During infection with these variant viruses in neural cells, virus populations generated did not change, in contrast to consistent selection of viruses with larger mRNA3 after wt JHMV infections. CNS virus produced abundant mRNA2a as well as 65K glycoprotein while the productions of both were trace in cl-2 infected cells. The present experiments, together with our previous observation, suggest that the larger E2 glycoprotein may be of importance for the replication in rat brain cells.',\n 'RNA-binding proteins of coronavirus MHV: Detection of monomeric and multimeric N protein with an RNA overlay-protein blot assay. Abstract RNA-binding proteins of coronavirus MHV-A59 were identified using an RNA overlay-protein blot assay (ROPBA). The major viral RNA-binding protein in virions and infected cells was the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50K). A new 140K virus structural protein was identified as a minor RNA-binding protein both in virions and in infected cells. The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M NaCl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies to bovine coronavirus: Characteristics and topographical mapping of neutralizing epitopes on the E2 and E3 glycoproteins. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to the Quebec isolate of bovine coronavirus were produced and characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to both the E2 and the E3 glycoproteins were found to efficiently neutralize virus in vitro. None of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the E1 glycoprotein neutralized virus infectivity. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein were all found to immunoprecipitate gpl90, gpl00, and their intracellular precursor protein gp170. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein immunoprecipitated gp124 and showed differential reactivity to its precursor proteins gp59 and gpl 18. These monoclonal antibodies also showed differential reactivity to an apparent degradation product of E3. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to E2 bound to two distinct nonoverlappig antigenic domains as defined by competitive binding assays. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein also bound to two distinct antigenic sites as defined by competitive binding assays plus a third site which overlapped these regions. Other results indicated that one domain on the E3 glycoprotein could be further subdivided into two epitopes. Thus four epitopes could be defined by E3-specific monoclonal antibodies.',\n 'Reduced mouse neurovirulence of poliovirus type 2 lansing antigenic variants selected with monoclonal antibodies. Abstract The Lansing strain of poliovirus type 2 is a mouse-adapted virus that induces a fatal paralytic disease in mice after intracerebral inoculation. Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the is variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent. These results suggest that specific amino acid changes within an antigenic site on the virion surface may result in reduction of mouse neurovirulence without affecting viral replication in cultured cells',\n 'Primary structure of the glycoprotein E2 of coronavirus MHV-A59 and identification of the trypsin cleavage site. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (E2) gene of MHV-A59 was determined from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. The E2 gene encodes a protein of 1324 amino acids including a hydrophobic signal peptide. A second large hydrophobic domain is found near the COOH terminus and probably represents the membrane anchor. Twenty glycosylation sites are predicted. Cleavage of the E2 protein results in two different 90K species, 90A and 90B (L. S. Sturman, C. S. Ricard, and K. V. Holmes (1985) J. Virol. 56, 904–911), and activates cell fusion. Protein sequencing of the trypsin-generated N-terminus revealed the position of the cleavage site. 90A and 90B could be identified as the C-terminal and the N-terminal parts, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison of the A59 and 1HM E2 proteins showed extensive homology and revealed a stretch of 89 amino acids in the 90B region of the A59 E2 protein that is absent in JHM.',\n 'Epitopes on the peplomer protein of infectious bronchitis virus strain M41 as defined by monoclonal antibodies. Abstract Sixteen monoclonal antibodies (Mcabs) were prepared against infectious bronchitis virus strain M41, all of them reacting with the peplomer protein. One of them, Mcab 13, was able to neutralize the virus and to inhibit hemagglutination. Competition binding assays allowed the definition of five epitopes, designated as A, B, C, D, and E, of which epitopes A and B are overlapping. Furthermore, the binding of Mcab 13 (epitope E) could be enhanced by the addition of Mcabs from group B, C, and D. A dot immunoblot assay was used to analyze the effect of denaturation on antibody recognition of the epitopes. Only the binding of Mcab 13 was affected, indicating that the epitope involved in neutralization and hemagglutination is conformation dependent. The epitopes A to D were highly conserved among IBV strains, while epitope E was specific for strains M41 and D3896. In this last strain, however, this epitope was not involved in neutralization.',\n 'Glucose trimming and mannose trimming affect different phases of the maturation of Sindbis virus in infected BHK cells. Abstract The roles of glucose and mannose trimming in the maturation of Sindbis virus in BHK cells have been investigated using inhibitors of glycoprotein oligosaccharide processing. In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc3Man8,9(GIcNAc)2 and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man9(GIcNAc)2. However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes. These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM. The results confirm the essential role of glucose trimming in the Sindbis virus-BHK cell system and suggest that the initial stages of mannose removal maybe important too.',\n 'Characterization of Kunjin virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Reinitiation of synthesis in Vitro. Abstract RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity was characterized in a cytoplasmic extract of Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells at 24 hr. The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed. However, anti-dsRNA plus detergent blocked activity by as much as 78% and label was found only in RF.',\n 'In Vitro synthesis of two polypeptides from a nonstructural gene of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59. Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of nonstructural gene 5 of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 has been determined. This sequence contains two potential open reading frames which overlap by five nucleotides. The putative protein products predicted from the sequence are a basic 13,000-Da polypeptide and a 9600-Da polypeptide containing an unusually long hydrophobic amino terminus. RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing each of the open reading frames in pGEM vectors direct the synthesis in vitro of polypeptides of the sizes predicted by the sequence. An RNA transcript containing both of the open reading frames directs the synthesis primarily of the polypeptide corresponding to the downstream open reading frame. These data suggest that MHV-A59 messenger RNA 5 potentially encodes two proteins and may be preferentially translated from an internal AUG initiation codon.',\n 'Identification of putative polymerase gene product in cells infected with murine coronavirus A59. Abstract The virion RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) is believed to be the mRNA for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The cell-free translation of virion RNA results in the synthesis of two predominant products p220 and p28 (M. R. Denison and S. Perlman, 1986, J. Virol. 60, 12–18). p28 is a basic protein and is readily detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When infected cells and isolated virions were assayed for this protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, p28 could be detected in infected cells labeled at late times after infection, but not at early times or in purified virions. p28 represents the first protein product of the putative coronavirus polymerase gene to be identified in infected cells.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid and matrix protein genes. Abstract The 3′ end of the 20-kb genome of the Mebus strain of bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV) was copied into cDNA and cloned into the PstI site of the pUC9 vector. Four clones from the 3′ end of the genome were sequenced either completely or in part to determine the sequence of the first 2451 bases. Within this sequence were identified, in order, a 3′-noncoding region of 291 bases, the gene for a 448-amino acid nucleocapsid protein (N) having a molecular weight of 49,379, and the gene for a 230-amino acid matrix protein (M) having a molecular weight of 26,376. A third large open reading frame is contained entirely within the N gene sequence but is positioned in a different reading frame; it potentially encodes a polypeptide of 207 amino acids having a molecular weight of 23,057. A higher degree of amino acid sequence homology was found between the M proteins of BCV and MHV (87%) than between the N proteins (70%). For the M proteins of BCV and MHV, notable differences were found at the amino terminus, the most probable site of O-glycosylation, where the sequence is N-Met-Ser-Ser-Val-Thr-Thr for BCV and N-Met-Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr for MHV. BCV apparently uses two of its six potential O-glycosylation sites.',\n 'The 5′-end sequence of the murine coronavirus genome: Implications for multiple fusion sites in leader-primed transcription. Abstract The coronavirus leader-primed transcription model proposes that free leader RNA species derived from the 5′-end of the genomic RNA are utilized as a primer for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5′-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5′-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3′-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5′-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7–18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.',\n 'Multiple recombination sites at the 5′-end of murine coronavirus RNA. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavinus, contains a nonsegmented RNA genome. We have previously shown that MHV could undergo RNA-RNA recombination in crosses between temperature-sensitive mutants and wild-type viruses at a very high frequency (S. Makino, J. G. Keck, S. A. Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729–737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5′-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5′-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5′-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of “copy-choice” recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.',\n 'Analysis of intracellular small RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus: evidence for discontinuous transcription. Abstract We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.',\n 'Intracellular accumulation of punta toro virus glycoproteins expressed from cloned cDNA. Abstract The Punta Toro virus (PTV) middle size (M) RNA encodes two glycoproteins, G1 and G2, and possibly a nonstructural protein, NSM. A partial cDNA clone of the M segment which contains G1 and G2 glycoprotein coding sequences but lacks most of the NSM sequences was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus under the control of an early vaccinia promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. Surface immune precipitation and 125I-protein A binding assays also demonstrated that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are retained intracellularly. These results indicate that the PTV glycoproteins contain the necessary information for retention in the Golgi apparatus.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the 3′ end of the feline coronavirus FIPV 79-1146 genome: Comparison with the genome of porcine coronavirus TGEV reveals large insertions. Abstract The genetic information, carried on mRNA 6 of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79–1146, was determined by sequence analysis of cDNA clones derived from the 3′ end of the FIPV genome. Two ORFs were found, encoding polypeptides of 11 K (ORF-1) and 22K (ORF-2). The FIPV sequence was compared to the 3′ end sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). ORF-1 has a homologous counterpart (ORF-X3) in the TGEV genome; both ORFs are located at the same position relative to the nucleocapsid gene. However, as a result of an in-frame insertion or deletion, ORF-1 is 69 nucleotides larger than ORF-X3. A similar event has occurred immediately downstream of ORF1: a 624-nucleotide segment, containing the complete ORF-2, is absent in the TGEV sequence. Most sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3′ noncoding sequences. ORF-X3 and ORF-1 are preceded by the sequence AAC-TAAAC, which is assumed to be the transcription-initiation signal in FIPV and TGEV (P. A. Kapke and D. A. Brian (1986) Virology 151, 41–49). By S1 nuclease analysis, the 5′ end of FIPV RNA 6 was mapped immediately upstream of this sequence. A 700-nucleotide TGEV-specific RNA was found by cross-hybridization with an FIPV 3′ end probe, suggesting that TGEV ORF-X3 is also carried on a separate mRNA. The differences at the 3′ ends of the FIPV and TGEV genomes maybe the result of RNA recombination events.',\n 'Synthesis of virus-specific RNA in permeabilized murine coronavirus-infected cells. Abstract We have developed a permeabilized cell system for assaying mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNA polymerase activity. This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.',\n 'Defective-interfering particles of murine coronavirus: Mechanism of synthesis of defective viral RNAs. Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the defective viral RNAs in cells infected with defective-interfering (DI) particles of mouse hepatitis virus was studied. Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.',\n 'Mouse thymic virus (MTLV; Murid Herpesvirus 3) infection in athymic nude mice: Evidence for a T lymphocyte requirement. Abstract Mouse thymic virus (MTLV; murid herpesvirus 3) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus that cytolytically infects developing T lineage lymphocytes in the thymus of neonatal mice. MTLV establishes a persistent infection and can be recovered indefinitely from infected mice, but nothing is known about requirements for this persistent infection. In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.',\n 'Cholesterol enhances mouse hepatitis virus-mediated cell fusion. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the L-2 subline of mouse fibroblasts results in acute infection characterized by extensive cell fusion. In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation. Thus membrane fusion resistance and MHV persistence are modulated but not alleviated by cell membrane cholesterol content.',\n 'Regional localization of virus in the central nervous system of mice persistently infected with murine coronavirus JHM. Abstract Suckling C57BU6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) develop either a fatal acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset demyelinating disease, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.',\n 'Sequence of mouse hepatitis virus A59 mRNA 2: Indications for RNA recombination between coronaviruses and influenza C virus. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the unique region of coronavirus MHV-A59 mRNA 2 has been determined. Two open reading frames (ORF) are predicted: ORF1 potentially encodes a protein of 261 amino acids; its amino acid sequence contains elements which indicate nucleotide binding properties. ORF2 predicts a 413 amino acids protein; it lacks a translation initiation codon and is therefore probably a pseudogene. The amino acid sequence of ORF2 shares 30% homology with the HA1 hemagglutinin sequence of influenza C virus. A short stretch of nucleotides immediately upstream of ORF2 shares 83% homology with the MHC class I nucleotide sequences. We discuss the possibilitythat both similarities are the result of recombinations and present a model for the acquisition and the subsequent inactivation of ORF2; the model applies also to MHV-A59-related coronaviruses in which we expect ORF2 to be still functional.',\n 'Primary structure and translation of a defective interfering rna of murine coronavirus. Abstract An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.',\n 'Role of oligosaccharides in the structure and function of respiratory syncytial virus glycoproteins. Abstract The contribution of oligosaccharides to the structural and functional make-up of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus G and F proteins was investigated by observing the effects of various oligosaccharide-specific enzymes on their molecular size as well as on virus infectivity. The N-linked oligosaccharides of the F protein were completely removed by endoglycosidase F and N-glycanase. Addition of oligosaccharides to F protein during synthesis was completely partially resistant to TM resulting in an 80-kDa form designated GTM. The G protein was estimated to contain approximately 3% N-linked and 55% O-linked carbohydrates, based on migration of G and GTM in polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, treatment of detergent-extracted G protein with endoglycosidase F and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, enzymes that specifically cleave N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, generated a variety of partially unglycosylated species, ranging in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 40 kDa. Virus infectivity was sensitive to limited removal of N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidases under conditions which did not greatly alter the molecular weight of the G protein. Thus, G and F protein oligosaccharides readily accessible to enzymatic removal are presumed to play an important role in the infectious process.',\n 'The amino-terminal signal peptide on the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus matrix protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation and glycosylation. Abstract cDNA clones mapping within the first 2601 bases of the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome were sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert and an open reading frame yielding a protein having properties of the matrix (M or E1) protein was identified. It is positioned at the 5′ side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from which it is separated by an intergenic stretch of 12 bases. The deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has a net charge of +7 at neutral pH. Thirty-four percent of its amino acid sequence is homologous with the M protein of the bovine coronavirus (BCV), 32% with that of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), and 19% with that of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Judging from alignment with the BCV, MHV, and IBV M proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for BCV, 26 for MHV, and 21 for IBV. Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. When mRNA from infected cells, or RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of the reconstructed M gene, was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the M protein became translocated and glycosylated. When a protein without the amino-terminal signal peptide was made by translating a truncated version of the M gene transcript, some translocation and glycosylation also occurred suggesting that the amino-terminal signal peptide on the TGEV M protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation. Interestingly, the amino-terminal peptide did not appear to be cleaved during in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes suggesting that a step in virion assembly may be required for proper exposure of the cleavage site to the signal peptidase.',\n 'Detection and characterization of subgenomic RNAs in hepatitis A virus particles. Abstract Defective viral particles containing deleted genomes were detected in harvests of cell cultures infected with various HAV isolates. The most prominent deletions were identified within the region of the genome coding for structural proteins. In this location three different deletions spanning nts 930–4380 (A), 1140–3820 (B), and 1370–3240 (C) were characterized. In addition to these internal deletions, various truncated RNAs were detected lacking either partially or completely the 3′ terminal region which is supposed to code for viral replicase. RNA molecules with internal deletions as well as those with 3′ terminal truncations could also be extracted directly from infected cells. During multiple consecutive passages of a given HAV strain, deletions A, B, and C accumulated and a quantitative increase of deleted RNAs occurred. Type and predominance of deletions varied with virus strains (CLF, GBM, MBB11/5, HM175, CR326, H141) and with the type of cells used for propagation (MRC-5, BGM, HELF, PLC/PRF/5). However, within the limits of the reliability of S1 analysis the endpoints of deletions A, B, and C were conserved. The mechanisms leading to formation of deletions remain unclear. Yet, some sequences flanking internal deletions showed homology with common splice signals and 3′ terminal truncations proved to be confined to a distinct region within the genome.',\n 'Detection of a murine coronavirus nonstructural protein encoded in a downstream open reading frame. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 5 contains two open reading frames. We have expressed the second open reading frame of this gene (gene 5 ORF 2) in an Escherichia coli expression system. This system utilized a plasmid which contained the promoter and the first 36 codons of the recA gene fused in frame with the MHV gene 5 ORF 2, which is fused in turn to the β-galactosidase gene. The protein product of this gene fusion was used to raise antibody to gene 5 ORF 2. The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro transcribed and translated protein product of gene 5 ORF 2. The second reading frame of MHV gene 5 was shown to be expressed during the course of infection by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoprecipitation using the antibody raised against the E. coli fusion protein and by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.',\n 'Characterization of coronavirus JHM variants isolated from wistar furth rats with a viral-induced demyelinating disease. Abstract Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause neurological disease when inoculated intracerebrally (ic) into mice and rats. Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the nucleocapsid protein gene of human coronavirus 229E. Abstract Human coronaviruses are important human pathogens and have also been implicated in multiple sclerosis. To further understand the molecular biology of human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the viral RNA have been initiated. Following established protocols, the 3′-terminal 1732 nucleotides of the genome were sequenced. A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5′-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence. The 3′-noncoding region of the genome contains an 11-nucleotide sequence, which is relatively conserved throughout the Coronavirus family and lends support to the theory that this region is important for the replication of negative-strand RNA.',\n 'Phylogeny of antigenic variants of avian coronavirus IBV. Abstract The sequences of the peplomeric S1 protein of four serologically distinct strains of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, have been determined. The S1 protein is thought to contain the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes and to be the main target of antigenic variation. An alignment with sequences of three strains published previously showed that from the 545 amino acid residues only 243 have been conserved. Clustering of substitutions suggests that most serotype determinants are located within the first 300 amino acid residues of S1. A phylogenetic tree of the S1 sequences showed very variable rates of divergence. Differences in topology with a tree based on RNAse-T1 fingerprint data indicate that some of the IBV strains have arisen by genetic recombination.',\n \"Evolution of the 5′-end of genomic rna of murine coronaviruses during passages in vitro. Abstract The 5′-ends of the genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs of murine coronavirus (MHV) have a stretch of approximately 70 nucleotides of leader sequences. The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.\",\n 'Comparison of six different murine coronavirus jhm variants by monoclonal antibodies against the e2 glycoprotein. Abstract We have examined six different JHMV variants, sp-4 (recloned wt JHMV), cl-2, CNSV, DL, DS, and JHM-X, in terms of the sizes of the mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein as well as their reactivity to a panel of monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein. Two of these variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, were found to have smaller mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein species compared with those of the other four variants. In addition, sp-4 and JHM-X were distinguished from the other four variants by their inability to bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two antigenic domains of the E2 molecule. Thus, six JHMV variants could clearly be divided into two groups with respect to the size and antigenicity of their E2 glycoproteins.',\n 'Maturation of Japanese encephalitis virus glycoproteins produced by infected mammalian and mosquito cells. Abstract The Japanese encephalitis virus (JE) structural glycoprotein (E) and two nonstructural glycoproteins (NS1 and NS1′) were processed differently by JE-infected vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines. All three proteins were released slowly (t 1 2 > 6 hr) from JE-infected monkey cells (Vero cells). Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (t 1 2 > 8 hr), while NS1 and NS1′ were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in Winked glycosylation were observed. E, NS1, and NS1′ found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NS1 and NS1′ found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. All three glycoproteins released from JE-infected Vero cells were associated with extracellular particles, the virion in the case of E and a low density particle in the case of NS1′ and NSV. Furthermore, E, NS1′ and NS1′ exhibited amphipathic properties in Triton X-114 extraction experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that both the structural (E) and nonstructural NS1′ and NSV) glycoproteins were accumulated within the secretory pathway of the infected Vero cells, assembled into particles, and then released into the extracellular fluid.',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix (El) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus protect mice from encephalitis. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix or El glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were tested for their ability to protect mice from a normally lethal challenge of MHV-4. Four antibodies were tested, and two of these,J.1.3 and J.3.9, were protective. Protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro, antibody isotype, recognition of a unique El antigenic site, or dependence on complement in vivo. Survival from acute encephalitis was followed by subacute demyelination, as has been shown with protection mediated by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the major glycoprotein, E2. These results demonstrate that antibodies which are specific for a viral matrix protein are able to alter the course of disease.',\n 'Spread of a neurotropic murine coronavirus into the CNS via the trigeminal and olfactory nerves. Abstract The route of entry into the central nervous system (CNS) of most neurotropic viruses has not been established. The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis.',\n 'Nucleotide sequence of bovine rotavirus gene 1 and expression of the gene product in Baculovirus. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes for the structural viral protein VP1 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) has been determined. The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5′- and 3′-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124–847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.',\n 'Molecular cloning of the gene encoding the putative polymerase of mouse hepatitis coronavirus, strain A59. Abstract Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed representing the genome RNA of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59). From these libraries clones were selected to form a linear map across the entire gene A, the putative viral polymerase gene. This gene is approximately 23 kb in length, considerably larger than earlier estimates. Sequence analysis of the U terminal region of the genome indicates the presence of the 66-nucleotide leader that is found on all mRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of the 5′terminal region suggests that transcription of leader terminates in the region of nucleotide 66. The sequence of the first 2000 nucleotides is very similar to that reported for the closely related JHM strain of MHV and potentially encodes p28, a basic protein thought to be a component of the viral polymerase (L. Soe, C. K. Shieh, S. Baker, M. F. Chang, and M. M. C. Lai, 1987, J. Virol., 61, 3968–3976). Gene A contains two of the consensus sequences found in intergenic regions. One is adjacent to the 5′ leader sequence and the other is upstream from the initiation codon for translation of gene B.',\n 'Complex formation between influenza virus polymerase proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Abstract All three influenza virus polymerase (P) proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes from microinjected in vitro transcribed mRNA analogs, with yields of up to 100 ng per oocyte. To examine the functional state of the Xenopus-expressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PB1 and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides polymerase complex.',\n 'Expression of the peplomer glycoprotein of murine coronavirus JHM using a baculovirus vector. Abstract The gene encoding the E2 peplomer glycoprotein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus JHM strain (JHMV) has been inserted into the genome of Autographa cafifornica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus (AcNPV) in lieu of the coding region of the AcNPV polyhedrin gene. This recombinant virus produced E2 protein in insect cells under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. The expressed E2 protein was shown in size and antigenic properties to be similar to the E2 protein produced in mouse cells infected by JHMV. The expressed E2 protein was glycosylated and transported to the cell surface; however, no proteolytic cleavage was detected in insect cells. The sera from rats immunized with partially purified E2 protein derived from insect cells reacted in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments with the E2 protein produced in JHMV-infected mouse cells. The antiserum failed to neutralize the infectivity of JHMV. These results suggest that the E2 protein expressed by the recombinant baculovirus in insect cells is similar but not identical to the E2 protein produced in JHMV-infected mouse cells. The inability of the E2 protein expressed in insect cells to produce neutralizing antibody is discussed.',\n 'Sequence analysis reveals extensive polymorphism and evidence of deletions within the E2 glycoprotein gene of several strains of murine hepatitis virus. Abstract Direct RNA sequence analysis of the E2 gene of wild-type MHV-4 and of neutralization resistant, neuroattenuated variants has identified a polymorphic region with respect to deletions. These variants had large deletions of 142 to 159 amino acids mapping to a localized region in the amino-terminal domain of the peplomer glycoprotein. The nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene for wild-type strain MHV-4 was found to be very similar to that of MHV-JHM but had an insertion of 423 nucleotides resulting in the addition of a stretch of 141 unique amino acids in the amino-terminal domain of E2. We propose that deletions reflect a major source of heterogeneity in the E2 protein of MHV.',\n 'Biosynthesis, structure, and biological activities of envelope protein gp65 of murine coronavirus. Abstract We have previously shown that gp65 (E3) is a virion structural protein which varies widely in quantity among different strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated. In vitro translation studies coupled with protease digestion suggest that gp65 is an integral membrane protein. The presence of gp65 in the virion is correlated with the presence of an acetylesterase activity. No hemagglutinin activity was detected.',\n 'Identification of essential residues in potyvirus proteinase HC-pro by site-directed mutagenesis. Abstract Two virus-encoded proteinases are responsible for proteolysis of potyvirus polyproteins. One of these, HC-Pro, is a multifunctional protein that autolytically cleaves at its carboxyl-terminus (J. C. Carrington et al., 1989, EMBO J. 8, 365–370). To identify the class of proteinase to which HC-Pro belongs, tobacco etch virus (TEV) HC-Pro mutants containing single amino acid substitutions at serine, cysteine, aspartic acid, and histidine positions were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Combinations of these residues are constituents of the active sites of diverse groups of cellular and viral proteinases. Only those positions that were strictly conserved among four potyvirus HC-Pro proteolytic domains (for which sequences have been deduced) were mutagenized. Of the 19 mutant proteinases synthesized and tested, only those with alterations at Cys-649 and His-722 were defective for HC-Pro autolytic activity. Most of the other mutant proteinases exhibited no impairments in processing kinetics experiments. The spectrum of essential residues, as defined by this genetic analysis, supports the hypothesis that HC-Pro most closely resembles members of the cysteine-type family of proteinases.',\n 'Chromatographic analysis of the aminoacyl-trnas which are required for translation of codons at and around the ribosomal frameshift sites of HIV, HTLV-1, and BLV. Abstract An examination of the frameshift signals or proposed signals within published sequences of retroviruses and other genetic elements from higher animals shows that each site utilizes a tRNA which normally contains Wybutoxine (Wye) base or Queuine (Q) base in the anticodon loop. We find experimentally that most of the Phe-tRNA present in HIV-1 infected cells lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop and most of the Asn-tRNA in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells lacks the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop. Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV. Thus, the lack of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop of tRNAs in retroviral infected cells is correlated with the participation of these undermodified tRNAs in the corresponding frameshift event. This suggests that the “shifty” tRNAs proposed by Jacks et al. (Cell 55, 447–458, 1988) to carry out frameshifting may be hypomodified isoacceptors.',\n 'Stably expressed FIPV peplomer protein induces cell fusion and elicits neutralizing antibodies in mice. Abstract We have established bovine papilloma virus (BPV)-transformed mouse C127 cell lines that synthesize the peplomer protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146. For this purpose, a new cassette expression vector pHSL, which carries the Drosophila HSp70 promotor and the polyadenylation signal of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, was constructed. Cocultivation of the BPV-transformed cell lines with FIPV-permissive feline fcwf-D cells resulted in polykaryocyte formation. Since it depended on the presence of fcwf-D cells, binding of E2 to the cell receptor may be required for membrane fusion. E2 was synthesized as a core-glycosylated protein of 180K which was only slowly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi: of the E2-molecules labeled during a 1-hr pulse about half was still completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H after a 2-hr chase, while the remaining E2 had been chased into multiple, partially endoglycosidase H-resistant forms. Immunofluorescence studies also indicated that most E2 was retained intracellularly. Mice immunized with whole lysates of the transformed cells produced FIPV-neutralizing antibodies as shown by plaque reduction.',\n 'Restriction of measles virus gene expression in acute and subacute encephalitis of Lewis rats. Abstract Measles virus (MV) replication in brain tissue of Lewis rats with acute (AE) and subacute (SAME) encephalitis was characterized by biochemical techniques. Messenger RNAs specific for measles virus nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P)-, matrix (M), fusion (F), and haemagglutinin (H) protein were detected in all brain extracts examined. The quantity of the individual MV mRNA species was quite different in comparison to lytically infected Vero cells. A steep gradient of MV transcripts was found in brain tissue which is most likely due to strongly attenuated transcription of mRNAs along the viral genome, representing particularly low transcription of the glycoprotein genes. In addition, in vitro translation assays only revealed synthesis of N and P protein in consistent fashion. The mRNAs for the glycoproteins did not direct the synthesis of detectable viral proteins whereas the M mRNA revealed some activity in animals with AE. The data indicate a strong restriction of the MV envelope gene expression in infected brain tissue, which is independent of the incubation time and type of the central nervous system (CNS) disease. This phenomenon which is similar to the findings observed in measles inclusion body encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis suggest that host factors may initially be responsible for the initiation of transcriptional and translational alterations.',\n 'Superinfection exclusion of vaccinia virus in virus-infected cell cultures. Abstract Vaccinia virus-infected BSC 40 cells do not permit the replication of superinfecting vaccinia virus. The extent of superinfecting virus propagation depends on the time of superinfection; there is 90% exclusion by 4 hr after the initial infection, and more than 99% by 6 hr. When superinfection is attempted at 6 hr after infection, the superinfecting virus is incapable of carrying out DNA replication or early gene transcription, demonstrating that an early event in the virus life cycle is inhibited. The rate of adsorption of the superinfecting virus is unaltered which shows that exclusion is affected at a point between adsorption and early gene transcription. In order to exclude superinfection, the primary infecting virus does not require replication of its DNA or expression of its late genes but it must express one or more early genes.',\n \"Protection from lethal coronavirus infection by affinity-purified spike glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus, strain A59. Abstract Murine hepatitis viruses provide excellent animal models for the study of virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have indirectly provided evidence that the spike glycoprotein (S) of these coronaviruses bears determinants for pathogenesis and the induction of protective immunity. In order to directly evaluate the immunogenicity of this protein, it was purified by affinity chromatography with an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective monoclonal antibody which immunoprecipitated the 180-kDa spike glycoprotein of the neurotropic A59 strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mice immunized twice with approximately 1 μg of purified S in Freund's adjuvant developed high titers of neutralizing and fusion inhibiting antibodies, even though the protein was at least partially denaturated after elution from the affinity column. Moreover, these mice were protected from lethal encephalitis when challenged intracerebrally with 10 LD50 of MHV-A59. This study provides a direct demonstration of the importance of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein in the induction of a protective immune response.\",\n 'Antigenic homology among coronaviruses related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract The antigenic homology of 26 coronavirus isolates, of which 22 were antigenically related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was determined with 42 monoclonal antibodies. Type, group, and interspecies specific epitopes were defined. Two group specific MAbs distinguished the enteric TGEV isolates from the respiratory variants. An antigenic subsite involved in neutralization was conserved in porcine, feline, and canine coronavirus. The classification of the human coronavirus 229E in a taxonomic cluster distinct from TGEV group is suggested.',\n 'Mouse hepatitis virus ORF 2a is expressed in the cytosol of infected mouse fibroblasts. Abstract A 266-bp fragment of cDNA from within gene B, ORF 2a, of MHV-A59 was used to construct a vector encoding a bacterial/viral fusion protein. Antiserum raised against this fusion protein specifically immunoprecipitates a 30K protein from infected 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts. The protein is localized primarily in the cytosol and not in the membranes. This is consistent with its predicted sequence and potential role as an RNA binding protein.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the membrane protein gene of human coronavirus 229E. Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are ubiquitous pathogens which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the complete nucleotide sequence of the membrane protein (M) gene was determined from cloned cDNA. The open reading frame is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence UCUAAACU, identical to the one found upstream of the N gene. The M gene encodes a 225-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 25,822, slightly higher than the apparent MW of 19,000–22,000 observed for the unprocessed M protein obtained after in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. The M amino acid sequence presents a significant degree of homology (38%) with its counterpart of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The M protein of HCV-229E is highly hydrophobic and its hydropathicity profile shows a transmembranous region composed of three major hydrophobic domains characteristic of a typical coronavirus M protein. About 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes a hydrophilic and probably external portion. One N-glycosylation and three potential O-glycosylation sites are found in this exposed domain.',\n 'Immunoglobulin Fc binding activity is associated with the mouse hepatitis virus E2 peplomer protein. Abstract Antigenic variation among murine coronaviruses is associated primarily with the surface peplomer protein E2 (180,000 Dal. E2 is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV-induced cell fusion, and eliciting neutralizing antibody. We report here the molecular mimicry between E2 and Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Molecular mimicry between E2 and FcyR may allow the escape of virus-infected cells from destruction by immunological mechanisms. Rabbit IgG, monoclonal rat IgG1 and IgG2b, monoclonal mouse IgG2a and IgG2b, and the rat anti-mouse FcγR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-infected cells a polypeptide with a molecular mass identical to that immunoprecipitated by anti-E2 antibodies. F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit IgG did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from MHV-infected cells. All of these antibodies did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. The anti-mouse FcyR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-, MHV-3-, or MHV-A59-infected L-2 cells and 17CL-1 cells, or MHV-JHM-infected cultures of neonatal BALB/c brain cells, a protein with a molecular weight identical to that of MHV-JHM E2. The anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. Furthermore, the 2.4132 monoclonal antibody (mab), unrelated rat and mouse monoclonal antibodies, and a goat antiserum against E2, but not normal goat serum, immunoprecipitated a 75,000- to 77,000-Da molecule from uninfected WEHI-3 cells, a FcγR bearing cell line. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab from MHV-JHM-infected cells is the E2 glycoprotein: (1) Partial proteolytic maps obtained by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease treatment of the 180,000-Da proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti FcγR mab and the anti-E2 mab were identical. (2) Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments from MHV-JHM-infected cells revealed that the same polypeptide chain was recognized by the anti-E2 mab and by the anti-FcγR mab 2.41G2. (3) Actinomycin D did not influence the induction and expression of the 180,000-Da polypeptide chain that was immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab, demonstrating that this protein is of viral origin.',\n 'Deduced sequence of the bovine coronavirus spike protein and identification of the internal proteolytic cleavage site. Abstract The sequence of the spike (also called peplomer or E2) protein gene of the Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was obtained from cDNA clones of genomic RNA. The gene sequence predicts a 150,825 mol wt apoprotein of 1363 amino acids having an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence of 17 amino acids, 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic anchor sequence of approximately 17 amino acids near the C terminus, and a hydrophilic cysteinerich C terminus of 35 amino acids. An internal Lys\\ue5f8Arg\\ue5f8Arg\\ue5f8Ser\\ue5f8Arg\\ue5f8Arg sequence predicts a protease cleavage site between amino acids 768 and 769 that would separate the S apoprotein into S1 and S2 segments of 85690 and 65153 mol wt, respectively. Amino terminal amino acid sequencing of the virion-derived gp100 spike subunit confirmed the location of the predicted cleavage site, and established that gp120 and gp100 are the glycosylated virion forms of the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Sequence comparisons between BCV and the antigenically related mouse hepatitis coronavirus revealed more sequence divergence in the putative knob region of the spike protein (S1) than in the stem region (S2).',\n 'Recommendations of the coronavirus study group for the nomenclature of the structural proteins, mRNAs, and genes of coronaviruses. Abstract We propose a nomenclature to replace the various systems currently in use to designate coronavirus structural proteins, mRNAs, and genes/open reading frames. The nonstructural proteins have not been addressed.',\n 'Analysis of the S spike (peplomer) glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus synthesized in insect cells. Abstract The bovine coronavirus (BCV) spike glycoprotein precursor (S, formerly termed peplomer) and its two subunit polypeptides (S1 and S2) were individually expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Each recombinant baculovirus expressed both glycosylated (S, 170K; S1, 95K; S2, 80K) and unglycosylated (S0, 140K; S10, 75K; and S20, 65K) forms of BCV spike polypeptides in Sf9 cells. The mature 95K S1 polypeptide was secreted whereas the S and S2 polypeptides remained cell-associated. The S precursor was partially cleaved in Sf9 cells, and the resulting S1 was also released into the medium. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies representing two antigenic domains bound to recombinant S and S1 but not the S2 polypeptides, indicating that two major epitopes for BCV neutralization are located on the S1 subunit.',\n 'Sequence comparison of the N genes of five strains of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus suggests a three domain structure for the nucleocapsid protein. Abstract To obtain information about the structure and evolution of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1 from cDNA clones. At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3′ UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic. Finally, we noted that four of the five N genes contain an internal open reading frame that potentially encodes a protein of 207 amino acids having a large proportion of basic and hydrophobic residues.',\n 'Primary structure and post-translational processing of the berne virus peplomer protein. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (P) protein gene of Berne virus (BEV), the torovirus prototype, was determined. The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.',\n 'Processing and intracellular transport of rubella virus structural proteins in COS cells. Abstract Plasmids encoding rubella virus (RV) structural proteins C-E2-Et, E2-Et, E2, and E1 have been constructed in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5. The processing and intracellular transport of these proteins have been examined by transient expression of the cDNAs in COS cells. Compared to alphaviruses, processing of RV glycoprotein moieties occurred relatively slowly and the transport of glycoproteins E2 and El to the plasma membrane was inefficient. Indirect immunofluoresence revealed that the majority of RV antigen in transfected and infected COS cells was localized to the Golgi region, including the capsid protein. Accumulation of capsid protein in the juxtanuclear region was determined to be RV glycoprotein dependent. Unlike alphaviruses, RV El did not require E2 for targeting to the Golgi where it was retained. E2 was however necessary for cell surface expression of Et. This study revealed that the processing and transport of RV structural proteins is quite different from alphaviruses and that the accumulation of antigens in the Golgi region may be significant in light of previous reports which suggest that RV buds from the internal membranes in some cell types.',\n 'Control of virus-induced cell fusion by host cell lipid composition. Abstract Virus-induced cell fusion has been examined in a series of stable cell lines which were originally selected for resistance to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced “from without” by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids. The ability of cellular lipid composition to regulate virus-induced membrane fusion suggests a possible role for lipids in viral infection and pathogenesis',\n 'Identification of the spinal cord as a major site of persistence during during chronic infection with a murine coronavirus. Abstract After intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gains entry into the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Under the appropriate conditions, some mice develop clinically apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks later, with virus always present in the spinal cord. To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHV in mice.',\n 'A clustering of rna recombination sites adjacent to a hypervariable region of the peplomer gene of murine coronavirus. Abstract Coronaviruses undergo RNA recombination at a very high frequency. To understand the mechanism of recombination in murine coronavirus, we have performed RNA sequencing of viral genomic RNA to determine the precise sites of recombination in a series of recombinants which have crossovers within the gene encoding the peplomer protein. We found that all of the recombination sites are clustered within a region of 278 nucleotides in the 5′-half of the gene. This region in which all of the crossovers occurred represents a small fraction of the distance between the two selection markers used for the isolation of these recombinant viruses. This result suggests that this region may be a preferred site for RNA recombination. The crossover sites are located within and immediately adjacent to a hypervariable area of the gene. This area has undergone deletions of varying sizes in several virus strains which have been passaged either in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest that a similar RNA structure may be involved in the occurrence of both recombination and deletion events.',\n 'Post-translational processing of the glycoproteins of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Abstract Intracellular events in the synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoproteins have been examined. We have shown by N-glycanase digestion that LCMV strain Arm-4 bears five oligosaccharides on GP-1 and two on GP-2. By pulse-chase labeling experiments in the presence of drugs which inhibit N-linked oligosaccharide addition and processing we demonstrate that addition of high mannose precursor oligosaccharides is necessary for transport and cleavage of the viral GP-C glycoprotein. Moreover, in the presence of tunicamycin which inhibits en bloc addition of these mannose-rich side chains, virus budding was substantially decreased and infectious virions were reduced by more than 1000-fold in the supernatant medium. Incubation in the presence of castantospermine, which permits addition of oligomannosyl-rich chains but blocks further processing, restored transport and cleavage of GP-C and maturation of virions. Finally, by temperature block experiments we have determined that maturation of GP-C oligosaccharides to an endoglycosidase H resistant form precedes cleavage to GP-1 and GP-2. The latter process is most likely to occur in the Golgi or post-Golgi compartment.',\n 'Sequence of the genome RNA of rubella virus: Evidence for genetic rearrangement during togavirus evolution. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the rubella virus (RUB) genomic RNA was determined. The RUB genomic RNA is 9757 nucleotides in length [excluding the poly(A) tail] and has a G/C content of 69.5%, the highest of any RNA virus sequenced to date. The RUB genomic RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), a 5′-proximal ORF of 6656 nucleotides and a 3′-proximal ORF of 3189 nucleotides which encodes the structural proteins. Thus, the genomic organization of RUB is similar to that of alphaviruses, the other genus of the Togavirus family, and the 5′-proximal ORF of RUB therefore putatively codes for the nonstructural proteins. Sequences homologous to three regions of nucleotide sequence highly conserved among alphaviruses (a stem-and-loop structure at the 5′ end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5′ end of the genome, and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site) were found in the RUB genomic RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the nonstructural ORF of RUB and alphaviruses revealed only one short (122 amino acids) region of significant homology, indicating that these viruses are only distantly related. This region of homology is located at the NH2 terminus of nsP3 in the alphavirus genome. The RUB nonstructural protein ORF contains two global amino acid motifs conserved in a large number of positive-polarity RNA viruses, a motif indicative of helicase activity and a motif indicative of replicase activity. The order of the helicase motif and the nsP3 homology region in the RUB genome is reversed with respect to the alphavirus genome indicating that a genetic rearrangement has occurred during the evolution of these viruses.',\n 'Sequence and expression analysis of potential nonstructural proteins of 4.9, 4.8, 12.7, and 9.5 kDa encoded between the apike and membrane protein genes of the bovine coronavirus. Abstract The nucleotide sequence between the spike and membrane protein genes in the bovine coronavirus (BCV) genome was determined by sequencing cDNA clones of the genome, and open reading frames potentially encoding proteins of 4.9, 4.8, 12.7, and 9.5 kDa, in that order, were identified. The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation. Thus, from a comparison between BCV and MHV we find evolutionary evidence for the importance of the CYAAAC sequence in regulating coronavirus transcription.',\n 'Mechanisms of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus neutralization. Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was neutralized more than 109-fold with antibodies of a single specificity [monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)]. Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2–3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio. Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed. Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization. In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity.',\n 'Genetics of mouse hepatitis virus transcription: Identification of cistrons which may function in positive and negative strand RNA synthesis. Abstract A panel of 26 temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 were selected by mutagenesis with either 5-fluorouracil or 5-azacytidine. Complementation analysis revealed the presence of one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups. None of the RNA− complementation groups transcribed detectable levels of positive- or negative-stranded RNA at the restrictive temperature. Temperature shift experiments after the onset of mRNA synthesis revealed at least two classes of RNA− mutants. RNA− complementation groups A, B, D, and E were blocked in the ability to release infectious virus and transcribe mRNA and genome, while group C mutants continued to release infectious virus and transcribe both mRNA and genome. Temperature shift experiments at different times postinfection suggest that the group C mutants encode a function required early in viral transcription which affects the overall rate of positive strand synthesis. Analysis of steady state levels of negative strand RNA after the shift indicate that the group C mutants were probably blocked in the ability to synthesize additional minus strand RNA under conditions in which the group E mutants continued low levels of minus strand synthesis. These data suggest that at least four cistrons may be required for positive strand synthesis while the group C cistron functions during minus strand synthesis.',\n 'Establishing a genetic recombination map for murine coronavirus strain A59 complementation groups. Abstract MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutants, representing one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups, were isolated and characterized by genetic recombination techniques. Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus.',\n 'Map location of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) capsid protein (Vpl) gene. Abstract Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is currently classified within the Togaviridae family. In an effort to obtain further information on the characteristics of this virus, we have begun to sequence the viral RNA genome and to map the virion structural protein genes. A sequence of 1064 nucleotides, which represents the 3′ terminal end of the genome, was obtained from LDV cDNA clones. A 3′ noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region. The presence of overlapping ORFs and the 3′ terminal map position of Vpi indicate that LDV differs significantly from the prototype alpha togaviruses.',\n 'Differentiation of acid-ph-dependent and -nondependent entry pathways for mouse hepatitis virus. Abstract Early events of infection of MHV were studied in comparison with those of VSV, which is known to enter cells by an endocytic pathway. Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.',\n 'Isolated HE-protein from hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and bovine coronavirus has receptor-destroying and receptor-binding activity. Abstract Bovine coronavirus (BCV) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) from swine were found to grow to high titers in MDCK I cells, a subline of Madin Darby canine kidney cells. Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein. This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV. Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too. The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside. Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form. After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy. The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses. HE protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells. However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus. The purified enzyme provides a useful tool for analyzing the cellular receptors for coronaviruses.',\n 'The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus mediates membrane fusion in insect cells. Abstract The hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), spike precursor (S) and the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike precursor protein of bovine coronavirus were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, and the cell-fusing activity of each recombinant glycoprotein was examined. Extensive syncytia formation was observed in cells infected with the S2 recombinant but not with the HE or S1 recombinant baculoviruses. Fusion of Sf9 cells expressing the intact S protein precursor was evident after trypsin treatment. These results demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of the S spike precursor is required for fusion induction and that the fusion is mediated by the S2 subunit. These observations may reflect the biological role of the S2 subunit in fusion-penetration during bovine coronavirus infection.',\n 'Comparison of the genome organization of toro- and coronaviruses: Evidence for two nonhomologous RNA recombination events during berne virus evolution. Abstract Recently, toroviruses and coronaviruses have been found to be ancestrally related by divergence of their polymerase and envelope proteins from common ancestors. In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein. The cluster of coronaviruses which contains this nonstructural gene expresses it not as a part of their polymerase, but by synthesizing an additional subgenomic mRNA.',\n 'The complete sequence (22 kilobases) of murine coronavirus gene 1 encoding the putative proteases and RNA polymerase. Abstract The 5′-most gene, gene 1, of the genome of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is presumed to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA known.',\n 'Structural characteristics of the M2 protein of influenza a viruses: Evidence that it forms a tetrameric channe. Abstract The evidence presented shows that the M2 protein of influenza A viruses exists in infected cells as a homotetramer composed of two disulfide-linked dimers held together by noncovalent interactions. The amphiphilic nature of the transmembrane α-helical domain is consistent with the protein forming a transmembrane channel with which amantadine, the specific anti-influenza A drug, interacts. Together these features provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that M2 has a proton translocation function capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the trans-Golgi network, a role important in promoting the correct maturation of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein.',\n 'Structural analysis of the conformational domains involved in neutralization of bovine coronavirus using deletion mutants of the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit expressed by recombinant baculoviruses. Abstract Two conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes, A and B, have been mapped to the S1 subunit of the S spike glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus (BCV). In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324–720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517–720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation. Our results suggest that the antigenic determinants formed by two domains are likely associated with the probable polymorphic region of the BCV S1 subunit.',\n 'Expression and frameshifting but extremely inefficient proteolytic processing of the HIV-1 gag and pol gene products in stably transfected rodent cell lines. Abstract Expression, ribosomal frameshifting, and proteolytic processing of HIV-1 GAG and POL proteins were investigated in heterologous mammalian cells in order to elucidate the influence of the cellular background on these events. DNA fragments encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK- and BHK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected. Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-1 protease encoding region.',\n 'Residues involved in the antigenic sites of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus S glycoprotein. Abstract The S glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been shown to contain four major antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D). Site A is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been previously subdivided into the three subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac. The residues that contribute to these sites were localized by sequence analysis of 21 mutants that escaped neutralization or binding by TGEV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN). Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. In addition, mar mutant 1B.H6 with residue 586 changed had partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586; i.e. this residue also is part of site A. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D is in agreement with PEPSCAN results. Site C can be represented by the peptide 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52 but is not exposed on the surface of native virus. Its accessibility can be modulated by treatment at pH >11 (at 4°) and temperatures >45°. Sites A and B are fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding, while sites C and D are fully or partially independent of glycosylation, respectively. Once the S glycoprotein has been assembled into the virion, the carbohydrate moiety is not essential for the antigenic sites.',\n 'cis acting RNA sequences control the gag-pol translation readthrough in murine leukemia virus. Abstract The pol gene of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) is expressed as a Gag-Pol fusion protein through an in-frame suppression of the UAG termination codon located between the two genes. The role of nucleotide context in suppression was investigated, in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system, using site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate that the translational readthrough is mediated by at least 50 bases long RNA sequence located 3′ to the gag UAG termination codon. Within this sequence a short purine-rich sequence adjacent to the amber codon, highly conserved among different retroviruses, appears essential for M-MuLV suppression. Two alternative putative stem and loop like RNA structures can be drawn at the gag-pol junction, one abutting the gag UAG codon, and the second downstream to it. None of these structures appears to be important to the suppression process.',\n 'Spread of the CVS strain of rabies virus and of the avirulent mutant AvO1 along the olfactory pathways of the mouse after intranasal inoculation. Abstract After intranasal instillation in the mouse, rabies virus (CVS strain) selectively infected olfactory receptor cells. In the main olfactory bulb (MOB), infection was observed in periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells and in interneurons located in the internal plexiform layer. Beyond the MOB, CVS spread into the brain along the olfactory pathways. This infection is specific to chains of functionally related neurons but at the death of the animal some nuclei remain uninfected. CVS also penetrated the trigeminal system. The avirulent mutant AvOl, carrying a mutation in position 333 of the glycoprotein, infected the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal nerve as efficiently as CVS. During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvO1 to penetrate several categories of neurons. From these observations, we concluded that CVS should be able to bind several different receptors to penetrate neurons, while the mutant would be unable to recognize some of them.',\n 'Golgi complex localization of the Punta Toro virus G2 protein requires its association with the G1 protein. Abstract The glycoproteins of bunyaviruses accumulate in membranes of the Golgi complex, where virus maturation occurs by budding. In this study we have constructed a series of full length or truncated mutants of the G2 glycoprotein of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, and investigated their transport properties. The results indicate that the hydrophobic domain preceding the G2 glycoprotein can function as a translocational signal peptide, and that the hydrophobic domain near the C-terminus serves as a membrane anchor. A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein. These results indicate that the G2 membrane glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein which does not contain a signal sufficient for Golgi retention, and suggest that its Golgi localization is a result of association with the G1 glycoprotein.',\n 'Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S genes specified by virulent and avirulent strains of bovine coronaviruses. Abstract The entire nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S) genes of the highly virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV) strain BCV-LY138, the avirulent BCV-L9 and related Norden Vaccine (BCV-Vaccine) strains were determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription of viral RNA, and to produce single strand cDNAs for DNA sequencing. The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9. The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteolytic cleavage site was identified in five strains while the sequence KRRSVR was found in BCV-Fl 5. Substitutions of few amino acids in the putative fusogenic domains and two prolines at 507 and 567 in the antigenic domains may cause altered immunogenic and other functional properties of the S proteins specified by the virulent and avirulent BCV strains. Nine amino acid substitutions between the virulent and avirulent groups may correlate with BCV virulence.',\n 'Comparison of bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigens: Monoclonal antibodies to the spike glycoprotein distinguish between vaccine and wild-type strains. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against two major structural proteins of the cell-adapted Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV-L9) were produced and characterized. Seven MAbs reacted with the peplomeric glycoprotein, gp100/S, while three MAbs reacted with the nucleoprotein p53/N in Western blot analysis of BCV polypeptides. MAbs to gp100/S reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gp100/S in Westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions. In contrast, MAbs to p53/N reacted in both types of Westerns, and those epitopes were thus continuous. MAbs to p53/N failed to neutralize BCV infectivity, while 4 MAbs to gp100/S neutralized BCV effectively. Cross reactivity of MAbs to gp100/S specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage, cell-culture-adapted strains in mildly denaturing Westerns and neutralization assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains, while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild-type strains. Non-neutralizing MAbs of gp100/S reacted with all seven strains in Westerns with the exception of one MAb that was specific for the highly cell-adapted strain BCV-L9.',\n 'A polycistronic mRNA specified by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract The third largest of the nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (mRNA3) from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains three separate open reading frames (3a, 3b, and 3c) which are not present on the next smallest of the mRNAs, suggesting that this mRNA may be functionally polycistronic. However, although a protein product has been identified from the 3c open reading frame, to date the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been established. We present nucleotide sequence data suggesting that each of the three open reading frames is conserved in a variety of different IBV strains and further show, through the preparation of monospecific antisera against bacterial fusion proteins, that IBV-infected cells contain small amounts of the products of these ORFs. In vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c open reading frames suggest strongly that all three proteins can be translated from a single molecular species, and expression studies carried out in intact cells support this conclusion. Thus mRNA3 of IBV appears to be functionally tricistronic.',\n 'Genomic and subgenomic RNAs of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus are both protein-linked and packaged into particles. Abstract The major subgenomic RNA of the calicivirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus which codes for the viral capsid protein has been cloned as cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of this mRNA was shown to be identical to the 3′ terminal region of the genomic RNA. The 5′ end of the mRNA corresponds to position 5296 of the genomic sequence; except for two differences the first 16 nucleotides of genomic and subgenomic RNAs are identical. After isolation from liver tissue viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs were found to be resistant to RNase degradation. This protection was due to RNA packaging into particles. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of liver homogenates allowed separation of such particles containing either genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA. Genomic and subgenomic RNAs are protein-linked and for the genomic molecule this interaction is localized within the first 179 nucleotides. After radioactive labeling of purified RNA and subsequent RNase treatment a protein of 15 kDa was identified.',\n 'De novo generation of defective interfering RNAs of tomato bushy stunt virus by high multiplicity passage. Abstract Defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the DIs suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for replication and encapsidation.',\n 'Primary structure of the membrane and nucleocapsid protein genes of feline infectious peritonitis virus and immunogenicity of recombinant vaccinia viruses in kittens. Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes a mostly fatal, immunologically mediated disease in cats. Previously, we demonstrated that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the FIPV spike protein (S) induced early death after challenge with FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1407–1409). In this paper we describe similar immunizations with the FIPV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus revealed 84.7 and 77% identity for M and N, respectively. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the cloned genes induced antibodies in immunized kittens. Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only. Immunization with the N protein recombinant had no apparent effect on the outcome of challenge. However, three of eight kittens immunized with the M protein recombinant survived the challenge, as compared to one of eight kittens of the control group.',\n 'Processing and antigenicity of entire and anchor-free spike glycoprotein S of coronavirus TGEV expressed by recombinant baculovirus. Abstract The S gene of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was inserted into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) using the transfer plasmid pVL941. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with the recombinant virus resulted in the synthesis of a 175K polypeptide which was able to trimerize and was transported to the cell surface as is the authentic TGEV S protein. Despite the lack of complete carbohydrate processing, the recombinant S protein exhibited antigenic properties similar to TGEV S and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats. Engineering a deletion (70 amino acids) into the carboxy-terminus containing the membrane anchor of the polypeptide allowed its secretion. The oligomerization process and the antigenic profile of the anchor-free S protein were shown to be partially altered.',\n 'The hemagglutinin/esterase glycoprotein of bovine coronaviruses: Sequence and functional comparisons between virulent and avirulent strains. Abstract The entire nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes specified by the highly virulent strain LY138 and the avirulent strain L9 of bovine coronavirus (BCV) were determined. These sequences were compared with recently published sequences of the HE genes of the Quebec and Mebus strains. A large open reading frame of 1272 nt encoding a protein of 424 amino acid residues was predicted. The putative esterase active site was conserved in the virulent and avirulent BCV strains, indicating that this domain is probably not a determinant for BCV virulence. Four amino acid substitutions occurred between the HE proteins of BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138 (Leu to Pro at 5, Leu to Val at 103, Ser to Pro at 367, and Thr to Asn at 379). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the HE glycoprotein inhibited the hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities of BCV-L9, but showed no inhibitory effect on the acetylesterase activity of BCV-LY138. These results suggest that at least one epitope is located proximal to one of the three strain-specific amino acids. Four S-specific monoclonal antibodies inhibited hemagglutination but not acetylesterase activity of BCVL9, implying that the S glycoprotein can promote hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes in addition to the HE glycoprotein.',\n 'Association of the infectious bronchitis virus 3c protein with the virion envelope. Abstract A highly purified radiolabeled preparation of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was analyzed, by immunoprecipitation with monospecific antisera, for the presence of a series of small virus proteins recently identified as the products of I BV mRNAs 3 and 5. One of these, 3c, a 12.4K protein encoded by the third open reading frame of the tricistronic mRNA3 was clearly detectable and was found to cofractionate with virion envelope proteins on detergent disruption of virus particles. These results, together with the hydrophobic nature of 3c and its previously demonstrated association with the membranes of infected cells, suggest strongly that 3c represents a new virion envelope protein, which may have counterparts in other coronaviruses.',\n 'Another triple-spanning envelope protein among intracellularly budding RNA viruses: The torovirus E protein. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the Berne virus envelope (E) protein gene was determined and its 26.5K translation product was identified by in vitro transcription and translation. Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence but containing three successive transmembrane α-helices in the N-terminal half, much the same as the coronavirus membrane (M) protein. The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum. The common features of the torovirus E and the coronavirus M protein support our hypothesis that an evolutionary relationship exists between these groups of intracellularly budding viruses.',\n 'Intracellular processing of the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus spike protein expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus. Abstract The Spike (S) protein from a virulent British field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) FS772/70 was constructed from cDNA and inserted into the vaccinia virus (VV) thymidine kinase gene locus under the control of the VV early/late gene P7.5K promoter. Recombinant S protein was synthesized as an endo-β-N-acetylglucosamini-dase H (Endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein with high mannose simple oligosaccharides (gp190) that underwent post-translational modification to an Endo H-resistant glycoprotein with complex oligosaccharides (gp210). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the majority of recombinant S protein was retained at the Golgi but some S protein was expressed on the plasma membrane. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against native S protein reacted with this recombinant S protein; also, mice infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing the S protein induced TGEV neutralizing antibodies. A truncated S protein (SΔ) was also expressed in rVV-infected cells by introducing a deletion into the S protein cDNA that removed 292 amino acids from the C-terminus. The SΔ protein (gpl70) was shown to be antigenically similar to TGEV S protein by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation tests but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not expressed on the cell surface.',\n 'Localization of extensive deletions in the structural genes of two neurotropic variants of murine coronavirus JHM. Abstract The intracellular RNA of two neurotropic variants of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) independently isolated from the brain and spinal cord of an infected Wistar Furth rat were compared with that of the parental virus. The mRNAs corresponding to the genes encoding the peplomer (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of the variant viruses were found to be smaller in size. The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties. These findings suggest that the changes in pathogenic properties of the two neural isolates are associated with drastic alterations of the viral structural glycoproteins.',\n 'Evolutionary relatedness of the predicted gene product of RNA segment 2 of the Tick-Borne Dhori virus and the PB1 polymerase gene of influenza viruses. Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/India/1313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PB1-like protein be designated the Pα protein of this virus.',\n 'The N-terminal heptad repeat region of reovirus cell attachment protein σ1 is responsible for σ1 oligomer stability and possesses intrinsic oligomerization function. Abstract The oligomerization domain of the reovirus cell attachment protein (σ1) was probed using the type 3 reovirus of synthesized in vitro. Trypsin cleaved the α1 protein (49K molecular weight) approximately in the middle and yielded a 26K N-terminal fragment and a 23K C-terminal fragment. Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact σ1 in the oligomeric form (∼200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in vitro was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact σ1 oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region. Our results are summarized in a model in which individual heptad repeats are held together in a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil structure via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.',\n 'Structure of the glycoprotein gene of sonchus yellow net virus, a plant rhabdovirus. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein (G) gene of sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), a plant rhabdovirus, was determined from viral genomic and mRNA cDNA clones. The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5′ end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3′ end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5′ leader sequence and a 115-nt untranslated 3′ end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals. In addition, the SYNV G protein contains a putative nuclear targeting site near the carboxy terminus, which may be involved in transit to the nuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis.',\n \"Hepatitis E virus (HEV): Molecular cloning and sequencing of the full-length viral genome. Abstract We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family\",\n 'Random nature of coronavirus RNA recombination in the absence of selection pressure. Abstract RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.',\n 'Bovine coronavirus nonstructural protein ns2 is a phosphoprotein. Abstract To investigate the nature of the bovine coronavirus (BCV) ns2 protein, the gene encoding this protein was cloned and was expressed as a β-galactosidase fusion protein. Antiserum raised against this protein reacted specifically with BCV-infected fixed cells in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and precipitated an in vitro synthesized product approximately 32-kDa in molecular weight and an equivalent protein from BCV-infected cells. The synthesis of ns2 was found to be similar to the structural proteins of BCV and pulse-chase experiments indicated that ns2 protein was stable and that it accumulated in BCV-infected cells. Synthesis of ns2 in the presence of [31P] orthophosphate revealed that it is a phosphoprotein. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the phosphorylated nature of ns2 and identified serine and threonine as its phosphorylated amino acid residues. This is the first demonstration of a phosphorylated nonstructural protein in coronavirus-infected cells.',\n 'Biochemical and biophysical characterization of the reovirus cell attachment protein σ1: Evidence that it is a homotrimer. Abstract The oligomerization state of the reovirus cell attachment protein σ1 (49K monomeric molecular weight) was determined by biochemical and biophysical means. Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-terminal truncated (protein product designated B) serotype 3 reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro were cotranslated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of σl. A total of four oligomeric protein bands (corresponding to A3, A2B1, A1B2, and B3, respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits. Biophysical characterization of purified σ1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric shape of σ1 and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be ∼132K (a trimer). Similar biophysical analysis on the two tryptic fragments of the σ1 [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (23K monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, respectively, both again corresponding to trimers. We therefore conclude that protein σ1 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that σ1 might be a higher order oligomer.',\n 'Characterization of the Sendai virus V protein with an anti-peptide antiserum. Abstract The Sendai virus V protein, which is a fusion of the P and V ORFs of the P gene, was characterized with antisera to a portion of the V ORF and compared to the P protein. The only property found in common with P is that V is also highly phosphorylated, and this is so even when these proteins are expressed independently of the other viral proteins. Otherwise, V was not found in virions, was not strongly associated with viral nucleocapsids like P, and anti-V had no effect on viral RNA synthesis in vitro under conditions where anti-P was highly inhibitory. The available evidence suggests that V may playa role in RNA synthesis, but it is not an essential one like that of the P protein.',\n 'Construction of tobacco mosaic virus subgenomic replicons that are replicated and spread systemically in tobacco plants. Abstract Two tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)derived replicons, created by deletion of most of the 126/183-kDa open reading frame (ORF), replicated and systemically invaded tobacco plants when supported by wild type TMV. One RNA replicon contained an internal direct repeat of 476 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the 30-kDa ORF. Although this RNA was replicated, most of the progeny were heterogeneous in size and smaller than the original transcript. A second TMV-derived RNA replicon, without any internally repeated sequences and containing a deletion of the 5′ portion of the 30-kDa ORF as well as most of the 126/183-kDa ORF, was created and coinoculated with wild type TMV as helper. This RNA also was replicated efficiently and systemically invaded tobacco plants. An examination of the sequences of cDNA clones obtained after PCR amplification of the progeny population of this RNA replicon demonstrated that the observed size heterogeneity was due to deletions and insertions adjacent to the artificially created deletion junction. These data demonstrate that a TMV infection is capable of supporting an artificially created RNA replicon, similar to defective interfering RNAs or satellites. However, these dependent RNAs were replicated without noticeably interfering with wild type TMV symptoms or replication.',\n 'Sequence analysis of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus genome segment B and its encoded VP1 protein: A putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking the Gly-Asp-Asp motif. Abstract The genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.',\n 'A prominent antigenic surface polypeptide involved in the biogenesis and function of the vaccinia virus envelope. Abstract Polypeptides of the vaccinia virus envelope exposed on the surface were identified by means of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin as a surface tag. Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.',\n 'Specific cell surface requirements for the infection of CD4-positive cells by human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and by simian immunodeficiency virus. Abstract Human CD4 was expressed on a range of mammalian cell lines. CD4+ non-primate cells, derived from rat, hamster, mink, cat, and rabbit, bind recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but are resistant to HIV-1 infection. CD4 expression on various human, rhesus, and African green monkey cell lines confers differential susceptibilities for HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency (SIV) strains. For example, CD4+TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells are sensitive to HIV-1 and HIV-2 but resistant to SIV, whereas CD4+ U87 glioma cells are resistant to HIV-1 infection but sensitive to HIV-2 and SIV. HIV-1 infection was not dependent on human major histocompatibility class I expression. Studies of cell fusion and of infection by vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelopes showed that the differential cell tropisms of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV are determined at the cell surface.',\n \"Defective RNAs of clover yellow mosaic virus encode nonstructural/coat protein fusion products. Abstract A small group of 1.2-kb RNAs present on polyribosoes from clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV)-infected tissue contains sequences from the genomic RNA (gRNA) of CYMV and is encapsidated by CYMV coat protein. Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant. This coding strategy represents a novel property of plant virus defective RNAs.\",\n 'Heterogeneity of gene expression of the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of murine coronaviruses. Abstract The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) membrane glycoprotein is present only in some members of the coronavirus family, including some strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3′-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.',\n 'Identification and analysis of the gag-pol ribosomal frameshift site of feline immunodeficiency virus. Abstract The pol genes of retroviruses are translated as gag-pol fusion proteins by ribosomal frameshifting within the gag-pol overlap region. During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.',\n \"Cloning and sequencing of the matrix protein (M) gene of turkey rhinotracheitis virus reveal a gene order different from that of respiratory syncytial virus. Abstract Several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein (F) have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) is a pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae of the Paramyxoviridae family. As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.\",\n 'RNA editing in the phosphoprotein gene of the human parainfluenza virus type 3. Abstract RNA editing of the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) phosphoprotein (P) gene was found to occur for the accession of an alternate discontinuous cistron. Editing occurred within a purine-rich sequence (AAUUAAAAAAGGGGG) found at the mRNA nucleotides 791–805. This sequence resembles an HPIV3 consensus transcription termination sequence and is located at the 5′-end of the putative D protein coding sequences. Editing at an alternate site (AAUUGGAAAGGAAAGG), mRNA nucleotides 1121–1136, for accession of a conserved V cistron, which is present in a number of paramyxovirus P genes, was not found to occur in HPIV3. In contrast with many other paramyxoviruses, editing was indiscriminate with the insertion of 1–12 additional G residues not present in the gene template. RNA editing was found to occur in both in vivo (HPIV3 infected cells) and in vitro (purified nucleocapsid complexes) synthesized mRNAs. Further, the in vitro prepared mRNA was edited regardless of whether the nucleocapsid complexes were transcribed in the presence or absence of uninfected human lung carcinoma (HLC) cell lysates. These results support the notion that RNA editing appears to be exclusively a function of viral proteins.',\n 'The 9-kDa hydrophobic protein encoded at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome is membrane-associated. Abstract The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly.',\n 'Sequence analysis of the spike protein gene of murine coronavirus variants: Study of genetic sites affecting neuropathogenicity. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, causes encephalitis and demyelination in susceptible rodents. Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneity of S gene sequence, particularly in the S1 region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also contribute to the differences in their biological properties.',\n 'MHV S peplomer protein expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus vector exhibits IgG Fc-receptor activity. Abstract We have previously shown that cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) bind rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG by the Fc portion of the IgG molecule. This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.',\n 'The hemagglutinin/esterase gene of human coronavirus strain OC43: Phylogenetic relationships to bovine and murine coronaviruses and influenza C virus. Abstract The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.',\n 'Identification of two new polypeptides encoded by mRNA5 of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract The second smallest subgenomic messenger RNA, mRNA5, of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus includes in its “5′ unique region” two separate open reading frames (5a and 5b), whose coding function has not so far been established, and thus it may represent a dicistronic messenger RNA. We report here that two polypeptides with the sizes expected for the 5a and 5b products can be synthesised by in vitro translation of a single artificial mRNA containing both the 5a and 5b ORFs. To establish whether these polypeptides represent genuine virus gene products, both the 5a and 5b coding sequences were expressed as bacterial fusion proteins, and these were used to raise monospecific antisera. Antisera raised against both the 5a and 5b-specific sequences recognized specifically proteins of the expected size in infectious bronchitis virus-infected chicken kidney and Vero cells, indicating that 5a and 5b do represent genuine virus genes, and suggesting that mRNA5 is indeed functionally dicistronic.',\n 'Genomic organization and expression of the 3′ end of the canine and feline enteric coronaviruses. Abstract The genomic organization at the 3′ end of canine coronavirus (CCV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) was determined by sequence analysis and compared to that of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine. Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3′ end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, which is currently designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs at the 3′ ends of their genomes. The presence of ORF 6b in three of four viruses in this antigenic cluster strongly suggests that TGEV has lost this ORF by deletion. The CCV ORF 6b is collinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the collinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other. Previously, we showed that the expression product of the FIPV ORF 6b can be detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation (Vennema et al., 1992). In the present study we have performed similar experiments with CCV and FECV. In infected cells both viruses produced proteins related to but different from the FIPV 6b protein.',\n \"Rearrangement of viral sequences in cytopathogenic pestiviruses. Abstract Two cytopathogenic isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (cpBVDV) have been analyzed. For both viruses two regions of their genomic RNAs were found to be duplicated and rearranged. The viral genomes contain a small duplicated element (SD) derived from the genomic 5' end far downstream of its original context. This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease p20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (p28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of p10, another viral protein. Molecular characterization of the respective noncytopathogenic counterpart revealed that duplication and rearrangement of sequences as well as the expression of p28 and p80 are specific for the cytopathogenic virus.\",\n 'Human coronavirus gene expression in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients. Abstract Total RNA extracted from both white and gray matter of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the nucleic acid of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and OC43, the two strains characterized to date and associated with respiratory infections. HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution. The fact that it was detected only in tissue from MS patients illustrates the need for continued studies on the possible role of coronaviruses in the etiology of MS.',\n 'Cell receptor-independent infection by a neurotropic murine coronavirus. Abstract The cellular receptors for a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been recently identified as one or more members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. The neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) possesses a highly fusogenic surface (S) glycoprotein. This protein is now shown to promote the spread of MHV into cells lacking the specific CEA-related MHV receptor. Resistant cells are recruited into MHV-induced syncytium with consequent production of progeny virus. Cell-to-cell spread of virus via membrane fusion without the requirement for specific cell surface receptor offers a novel way for virus to spread within infected hosts.',\n 'Characterization of the specificity and genetic restriction of human CD4+ cytotoxic T cell clones reactive to capsid antigen of rubella virus. Abstract Using 11 overlapping synthetic peptides covering more than 95% of the amino acid sequence of capsid protein of rubella virus, 7 CD4+ T cell clones (R10, R11, R18, A2, A10, A1, and A12) isolated from 2 rubella seropositive donors reacted strongly to rubella capsid peptides C6 (residues 119–152), C9 (residues 205–233), or C11 (residues 255–280), respectively, in both proliferation and cytotoxicity assay. Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125–139), C9B (residues 205–216), and C11E (residues 260–272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and C11, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 by T cell clones (R11 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and A11, A10, and A12) that reacted with peptide C9 or C11 was DR4 molecule. However, there may be a cross-recognition by the T cell clone (A12) between DR1 and DR4 subtypes.',\n 'Conserved tertiary structure elements in the 5′ untranslated region of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Abstract A combination of comparative sequence analysis and thermodynamic methods reveals the conservation of tertiary structure elements in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3′ end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed “ribosome landing pad” (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5′ UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886–5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed. The proposed common structure implicates a biological function for these sequences in translational initiation.',\n 'The Murray Valley encephalitis virus prM protein confers acid resistance to virus particles and alters the expression of epitopes within the R2 domain of E glycoprotein. Abstract To study the role of the precursor to the membrane protein (prM) in flavivirus maturation, we inhibited the proteolytic processing of the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus prM to membrane protein in infected cells by adding the acidotropic agent ammonium chloride late in the virus replication cycle. Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.',\n 'Identification of the active site residues in the nsP2 proteinase of sindbis virus. Abstract The nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus are processed by a virus-encoded proteinase which is located in the C-terminal domain of nsP2. Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.',\n 'Rice dwarf phytoreovirus segment S12 transcript is tricistronic in Vitro. Abstract Sequence analysis revealed that rice dwarf phytoreovirus segment S12 is 1066 nucleotides long with a small out-of-phase, overlapping open reading frame (ORF) as well as a major ORF. The large ORF (positions 42 to 980) encodes 312 amino acids, while the small one (bases 313 to 591) encodes 92 amino acids with an additional in-frame AUG codon (positions 337–339) 24 nucleotides downstream from the first one. Transcripts from a full-length cDNA directed the in vitro synthesis of three polypeptides of 33 (considered to be translated from the long ORF), 8, and 7 kDa. Alteration of each of the two ATG codons on the small ORF demonstrated their involvement in the generation of the 8- and 7-kDa polypeptides. Although it is still unknown whether these proteins are expressed in vivo, the small ORF is shown to be conserved in S9s of two other members of the genus Phytoreovirus, rice gall dwarf virus and wound tumor virus, suggesting its common, important function.',\n 'The V5A13.1 envelope glycoprotein deletion mutant of mouse hepatitis virus type-4 is neuroattenuated by its reduced rate of spread in the central nervous system. Abstract Following intracerebral inoculation of adult Balb/c Byj mice, the MHV-4 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) had an LD50 of <0.1 PFU, whereas its monoclonal antibody resistant variant V5A13.1 had an LD50 of 104.2 PFU. To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.',\n 'Immune response to a murine coronavirus: Identification of a homing receptor-negative CD4+ T cell subset that responds to viral glycoproteins. Abstract The lymphocyte proliferative response to mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a well-described cause of chronic and acute neurological infections, has been studied using vaccinia virus recombinants expressing individual MHV proteins. The surface (S) and transmembrane (M) glycoproteins were the most active proteins in causing proliferation of lymphocytes isolated from immunized adult mice, whereas lymphocytes from persistently infected mice proliferated only in response to the S protein. The cells from immunized mice which proliferated most actively in response to MHV were positive for the CD4 antigen and secreted interferon-γ. In addition, the most responsive subset of cells did not express gpg0MEL-14, the lymph node-specific homing receptor. The results identify a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that may be an important component of the cell-mediated immune response to this virus. The data also suggest that response to the M protein is important in preventing disease progression in C57BL/6 mice since cells which recognize this protein are absent from persistently infected mice.',\n 'Comparison of a dengue-2 virus and its candidate vaccine derivative: Sequence relationships with the flaviviruses and other viruses. Abstract A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.',\n 'Rabies virus glycoprotein is a trimer. Abstract The oligomerization state of the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (G protein) was determined using electron microscopy and sedimentation analysis of detergent solubilized G. Most of the detergents used in this study solubilized G in a 4 S monomeric form. However, when CHAPS was used, G had a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S. This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from M1 and M2. Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction. End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G. End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure. Electron microscopy also showed that G had a “head” and a “stalk” and provided the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure.',\n 'TGEV corona virus ORF4 encodes a membrane protein that is incorporated into virions. Abstract The coding potential of the open reading frame ORF4 (82 amino acids) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been confirmed by expression using a baculovirus vector. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4. Our results led us to propose that ORF4 represents a novel minor structural polypeptide, tentatively designated SM (small membrane protein).',\n 'Neuraminidase treatment of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus reveals a hemagglutinating activity that is dependent on sialic acid-containing receptors on erythrocytes. Abstract The interaction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with erythrocytes was analyzed. The binding activity of IBV was not sufficient to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, it acquired hemagglutinating activity after treatment with neuraminidase to remove α2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the surface of the virion. Pretreatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase rendered the cells resistant to agglutination by IBV. Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain α2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid α2,3-linked to galactose. In contrast to other enveloped viruses with such a binding specificity (influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses) IBV lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme.',\n 'Evidence for variable rates of recombination in the MHV genome. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo RNA recombination at high frequency during mixed infection. Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S gene.',\n 'Mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are Ld restricted and specific for the carboxy terminus. Abstract Infection of mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an acute encephalomyelitis associated with primary demyelination of the central nervous system. Efforts at understanding the components of the immune response in the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination have implicated the antibody response and both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. In this report, we demonstrate that Balb/c (H-2°) mice immunized with the JHM (JHMV) strain of MHV develop a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. One population of these virus-specific CTL recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either the entire N protein or carboxy-terminal deletions were used to determine the number and location of the epitope(s) recognized. The CTLs were found to recognize a peptide contained within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids of the N protein. Analysis of infected cell lines expressing transfected major histocompatibility genes demonstrated that the anti-N protein CTLs were restricted exclusively to the L° molecule. These data provide the first definition of a MHV-specific CTL response directed to a viral protein and suggest that the anti-N protein CTL response is one potential mechanism used by the host to clear JHMV from the central nervous system.',\n 'Intracellular processing of the N-terminal ORF 1a proteins of the coronavirus MHV-A59 requires multiple proteolytic events. Abstract Several polypeptide products of MHV-A59 ORF 1a were characterized in MHV-A59 infected DBT cells, using antisera directed against fusionn roteins encoded in the first 6.5 kb of ORF1a. These included the previously identified N-terminal ORF 1a product, p28, as well as 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa polypeptides. P28 was always detected as a discrete band without larger precursors, suggesting rapid cleavage of p28 immediately after its synthesis. Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in vivo. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of >320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORF1a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290- and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like protease activities.',\n 'A single point mutation of the influenza C virus glycoprotein (HEF) changes the viral receptor-binding activity. Abstract From strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus a mutant was derived with a change in the cell tropism. The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence. Sequence similarity with a stretch of amino acids involved in the receptor-binding pocket of the influenza A hemagglutinin suggests that the mutation site on the influenza C glycoprotein (HEF) is part of the receptor-binding site.',\n 'Antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus nucleoprotein. Abstract A group of 11 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to study the antigenic structure of the virus nucleoprotein (N). To identify the regions recognized by MAbs, DNA fragments derived from the N-coding region of the TGEV strain FS772/70 were cloned into pUR expression plasmids and the antigenicity of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by immunobloting. A major antigenic domain was identified, covering the first 241 amino acid residues of N, within which an epitope (residues 57–117) was also found. A second antigenic domain extended from residues 175 to 360 of the nucleoprotein, within which a subsite was characterized within the region covering residues 241–349. MAb DA3 recognized a linear epitope which mapped within residues 360 and 382 at the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein. The binding of the majority of the MAbs (8 out of 11) to large fusions, but not to smaller fragments included in them, suggests a conformational dependence of the MAb binding sites. Our data show that the use of fusions in Western blot experiments is a useful approach to map not only linear epitopes but more complex antigenic structures found in the nucleoprotein of TGEV.',\n 'Coronavirus infects and causes demyelination in primate central nervous system. Abstract Two species of primates, Owl and African green monkeys, were inoculated intracerebrally with either the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus JHM or the putative multiple sclerosis brain coronavirus isolate SD. These viruses caused an acute to subacute panencephalitis and/or demyelination in the infected animals. The course of pathogenesis and sites of detected viral RNA and antigen was dependent both on animal species and virus strain but the results clearly showed that these viruses replicated and disseminated in the central nervous system (CNS) of these primates. This study suggests that human CNS may be susceptible to coronavirus infection.',\n 'Coronavirus mRNA synthesis: Identification of novel transcription initiation signals which are differentially regulated by different leader sequences. Abstract The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.',\n 'The replication of cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus defective interfering-satellite RNA hybrid molecules. Abstract A DNA copy of DI RNA of cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus was cloned downstream of a phage T7 promoter. In vitro-transcribed RNA replicated in Nicotiana clevelandii when coinoculated with full-length viral genomic RNA transcripts and protected plants from apical necrosis. Artificial deletion mutants derived from the DI RNA clone showed that most of the central sequence block is necessary for replication. Hybrid DI RNA-satRNA clones were prepared and in vitro-synthesized RNA was inoculated to plants in the presence of helper viral RNA. There was replication only of in vitro transcripts derived from hybrid clones where satRNA sequences were inserted upstream or downstream from the central block, but not of those derived from clones where satRNA sequence replaced the central block. Progeny RNA of biologically active clones was either full-length or showed deletions depending on the insertion of satRNA sequences in DI RNA. DI RNA-satRNA constructs having part of the 5′ region exchanged were not replicated.',\n 'Genetic evolution and tropism of transmissible gastroenteritis coronaviruses. Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus isolated for the first time in 1946. Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses. Point mutations and probably recombination events have occurred during TGEV evolution.',\n 'Structural, functional, and immunological characterization of bovine herpesvirus-1 glycoprotein gl expressed by recombinant baculovirus. Abstract The major glycoprotein complex gl of bovine herpesvirus-1 was expressed at high levels (36 μg per 1 × 106 cells) in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. The recombinant gl had an apparent molecular weight of 116 kDa and was partially cleaved to yield 63-kDa (glb) and 52-kDa (glc) subunits. This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for eight different epitopes recognized recombinant gl, indicating that the antigenic characteristics of the recombinant and authentic glycoproteins are similar. In addition, the recombinant gl was as immunogenic as the authentic gl, resulting in the induction of gl-specific antibodies in cattle.',\n 'Comparison of cytopathogenicity, immunofluorescence and In situ DNA hybridization as methods for the detection of adenoviruses. Abstract Three different methods were compared for their efficiency at detection of adenoviruses. The samples examined for viral analysis consisted of concentrates prepared from raw sewage, chosen as providing a representation of the spectrum of viruses being intestinally shed from a large population at any given time. When using one single cell line, HEp-2, the overall numbers of adenoviruses detected using cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were roughly equal. In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence. The relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present in the sewage concentrates we examined was, on average, 94-fold greater than that of enteroviruses. Assay of enteroviruses was performed by plaque assay in the BGM cell line.',\n 'Public health considerations associated with molluscan aquaculture systems: Human viruses. Abstract The documentation of several recent outbreaks of human virus diseases associated with the consumption of shellfish has reiterated the threat posed by these agents to the shellfish industry. This article reviews pertinent outbreaks, identifies principal viral agents involved, and delineates systems which may be at greatest risk. The results of two recent laboratory studies which sought to define environmental factors that contribute to virus accumulation by shellfish are also discussed. First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below ⋍0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virginica and M. mercenaria). Viruses were found to be most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.',\n 'Recent achievements in studies on diseases of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Abstract Parasitic, fungal, bacterial and viral diseases of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) are reviewed. Besides a general overview of parasites of carp, swimbladder inflammation, caused by Sphaerospora spp., is discussed in detail. Saprolegnia spp. is the most important fungal pathogen. Aeromonas hydrophila and the atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Flexibacter columnaris, are described as the major bacterial pathogens of carp. Spring viraemia of carp caused by Rhabdovirus carpio is presented as the main viral infection of common carp. Details on methods of treatment and prevention are presented together with a description of the given diseases. The role of environmental stress, including “normal” culture practice and pollution, in the outbreak of diseases of common carp is discussed. Prospective methods to minimize the risk of diseases as well as their limitations are presented.',\n 'N-linked protein glycosylation in the rat parotid gland during aging. Abstract N-Linked protein glycosylation was examined in vitro in dispersed rat parotid acinar cells from young adult (3–6 months) and aged (22–24 months) rats. A small decrease in general protein production was observed with cells from aged animals (∼20% lower incorporation of [14C]leucine into 10% CCI3 COOH insoluble protein during continuous pulse labeling). Incorporation of [3H]mannose into N-linked glycoproteins by aged cells was further reduced (∼35%). Similarly microsomal membranes from parotid glands of aged animals showed ∼50% reduction in the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key intermediate in the dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation. Man-P-Dol synthase, the microsomal enzyme responsible for production of this saccharide-lipid, displayed no change in apparent K m for GDP-mannose when preparations from aged animals were utilized, but did show ∼50% reduction in V max. Following β-adrenoreceptor activation, cells from both young adult and aged glands showed increased N-linked protein glycosylation almost to the same extent (∼2-fold). The data suggested that in aged rat parotid cells there is a basal reduction of activity in the pathway responsible for asparagine-linked protein glycosylation, but that following exocytotic stimuli this pathway responds in a manner comparable to cells from young adult glands.',\n 'Pathology and toxicology of beluga whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada. Past, present and future. Abstract An indigenous population of 450–500 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) inhabiting the St. Lawrence Estuary has been exposed chronically for more than 50 years to a complex mixture of industrial pollutants including organochlorinated compounds (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals. From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales. OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[α]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[α]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.',\n 'Hazard to man and the environment posed by the use of urban waste compost: a review. Abstract This review presents the current state of knowledge on the relationship between the environment and the use of municipal waste compost in terms of health risk assessment. The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Further research is needed on the risk related to inhalation of chemical compounds.',\n '[2] Families of serine peptidases. Publisher Summary This chapter examines families of serine peptidases. Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common “catalytic triad” of three amino acids—namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.',\n 'Multiple sclerosis: Possible immunological mechanisms. Abstract Multiple sclerosis is the principal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low, averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.',\n 'Cocaine: On-line analysis of an accumbens amine neural basis for psychomotor behavior. Abstract Dose-response studies on subcutaneous cocaine were done to ascertain its effects in nucleus accumbens in dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal circuitry in the behaving rat with in vivo voltammetry. Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear),w hich is highly correlated (ϱ=.983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.',\n \"In vivo voltammetric studies on release mechanisms for cocaine with γ-butyrolactone. Abstract The effect of cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) on presynaptic mechanisms of release for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (5-HT) was studied in nucleus accumbens of unrestrained rats (Rattus norvegicus). The studies were done by assaying synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the presence of the neuronal impulse flow inhibitor, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL). The results were compared with cocaine effects on accumbens DA and 5-HT in the freely moving rat, without γ-BL treatment. A neurochemical time course profile showed that the cocaine-induced increase in accumbens synaptic concentrations of DA was significantly blocked (p<0.0001) after DA impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.0038) by γ-BL (35.8%). The neurochemical time course profile concurrently showed that the cocaine-induced decrease in accumbens synaptic concentrations of 5-HT was significantly blocked (p<0.0004) after impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.025) by γ-BL (50.6%). The findings show that cocaine's effects on synaptic concentrations for DA and for HT in accumbens are dependent on neuronal impulse flow. The findings indicate that presynaptic releasing mechanisms, which may be different for DA vis-à-vis 5-HT, play a role in the mechanism of action of cocaine.\",\n \"Cocaine's colocalized effects on synaptic serotonin and dopamine in ventral tegmentum in a reinforcement paradigm. Abstract The effect of subcutaneous (SC) cocaine (20 mg/kg) on synaptic concentrations of the biogenic amines, dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) in Ventral Tegmental Area, (VTA-[A10]) was studied in freely moving and behaving rats (rattus norvegicus) with in vivo voltammetry (in vivo electrochemistry). The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT (p < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.\",\n \"Distinguishing effects of cocaine IV and SC on mesoaccumbens dopamine and serotonin release with chloral hydrate anesthesia. Abstract The effect of IV cocaine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) was studied on synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] in the mesoaccumbens nerve terminal, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), in chloral hydrate-anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (p < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the γ-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.\",\n 'Real time detection of acute (IP) cocaine-enhanced dopamine and serotonin release in ventrolateral nucleus accumbens of the behaving Norway rat. Abstract Cocaine (10 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneal (IP), was studied for its effects on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release in ventrolateral nucleus accumbens (vlNAcc) of conscious and behaving male, virus-free, Sprague-Dawley rats with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form of four behavioral components (i.e., the classically DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity [ambulations], rearing, and stereotypy, and a 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations) were studied concurrently with infrared photobeam detection. The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 min after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc. Importantly, 5-HT may signal the known DA response to cocaine.',\n 'Ibogaine modulates cocaine responses which are altered due to environmental habituation: In vivo microvoltammetric and behavioral studies. Abstract Ibogaine, a serotonergic (5-HTergic) indole alkaloid, was studied for cocaine modulatory effects on four parameters of behavior by computerized infrared photocell beam detection. The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.',\n 'Bronchiolitis and asthma: Possible common pathogenetic pathways. Abstract A discussion of possible mechanisms for virus-induced wheezing in normal and asthmatic children is presented. Presently attractive theories for immune injury in viral bronchiolitis include those which depend on pathology induced by types 1, 3, and 4 of Gell and Coombs. The continuum of viral bronchiolitis with virus-induced wheezing in young children who are labeled “asthmatic” argues for some common mechanism of bronchiolar obstruction.',\n 'Immunoglobulin E response during viral infections. Abstract One hundred and three patients (90 nonatopics and 13 atopics) with respiratory infections to various viral agents were studied retrospectively with respect to IgE immunoglobulin levels during acute (1 to 7 days) and convalescent (8 to 30 days) phases of infection. It was found that 59% of patients had a decrease of 20% or more in IgE level, 27% remained the same, and only 14% showed a rise of 20% or more from the acute to the convalescent phases of infection. IgE levels decreased up to 3 to 4 wk after symptoms and the degree of decrease was more apparent for the nonatopics who had higher IgE levels in their acute phase of infection. Less dramatic decrease in IgE was observed for the 13 atopics studied. The changes in IgE levels during the viral infectious period are discussed in terms of possible cellular mechanisms that may control IgE immunoglobulin.',\n 'Development of allergy in children I. Association with virus infections. Abstract Children born into allergic families, with two allergic parents, are at high risk of developing allergy within the first 5 years of life. In order to observe possible external factors in the sensitization process, a prospective study of 13 such children was done, in which serial clinical and immunologic observations were made at 3- to 6-month intervals over a period of 1 to 4 yr. Eleven of these children are now clinically allergic; 5 have asthma. Immunologic evidence for allergic sensitization was observed in these 11 children by RAST, antigen-induced leukocyte histamine release, lymphoblastogenesis, and rise in serum IgE. Upper respiratory infections (URI) occurred in these 11 allergic children 1 to 2 months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization. In 10 of these 11 URI children, complement-fixing antibodies to viruses (parainfluenza, RSV, CMV) increased in the same blood samples in which immunologic allergic sensitization was first evidenced. This coincidence suggests that certain viruses may contribute to the allergic sensitization process.',\n 'Mucosal immunity: The immunology of breast milk. Abstract The mammary glands represent one part of the mucosal immune system, a definable, subunit of humoral and cellular immune functions in man that appears to have developed particular qualities well suited to guard our interface with the environment. As our understanding of secretory immunoglobulins and lymphocyte migration patterns continues to develop, the immunologic components found in breast milk appear increasingly likely to play a specific immunologic role in the protection of the nursing infant. The biologic basis for the observed protective effect of breast-feeding is reviewed with an emphasis on the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of mucosal immunity in general.',\n 'Upper airway inflammatory diseases and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Abstract Inflammatory processes of the upper airway may alter the responsiveness of the lower airway. For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways. Both of these examples suggest that inflammatory processes occurring totally or primarily in the upper airway may participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness and asthma.',\n 'Interaction of paramyxoviruses with human basophils and their effect on histamine release. Abstract We have demonstrated that human peripheral blood basophils released histamine on direct incubation with paramyxoviruses in vitro. Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 ± 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 ± 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 ± 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fcϵ receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils. Our findings provide evidence for another mechanism by which respiratory viruses can initiate inflammation.',\n 'Rhinovirus 39 infection in allergic and nonallergic subjects. Abstract To determine if individuals with allergic rhinitis are hyperresponsive to upper respiratory tract viral infections, 20 allergic and 18 nonallergic, susceptible, adult volunteers were challenged and infected with rhinovirus type 39 before the pollen seasons. Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response. However, for decreased mucociliary clearance rate, increased nasal congestion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and symptoms of sneezing, the allergic group demonstrated an earlier onset compared with that of the nonallergic group. The biologic significance of the differences in onset of dysfunction is tempered by the observation that the temporal pattern of responses in the allergic group was similar with that of nonallergic subjects in previous studies. The results of the present study do not support the hypothesis of a physiologic hyperresponsiveness to rhinovirus type 39 infection in allergic subjects during nonallergy seasons.',\n 'Acute viral gastroenteritis. Abstract Two virus-like particles have been found to be associated with acute viral gastroenteritis. One, a 270-nm parvovirus-like particle (the Norwalk agent), was visualized and recognized by immune electron microscopy in an infectious stool filtrate derived from a community outbreak of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. It appears to be one of the etiologic agents of a usually self-limited form of gastroenteritis which commonly occurs in community outbreaks. The other, a 70-nm reovirus-like particle, has been observed by electron microscopy in specimens from infants and children with severe diarrhea in many parts of the world. The reovirus-like particle may emerge as a major etiologic agent of diarrhea of infants and young children.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases: Tropism of the JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus for cells of glial origin. Abstract Infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus causes demyelinating lesions resulting from an infection of the oligodendroglia. This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hallé strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo. Systems such as the one described here may now offer a specific screening procedure for selecting, identifying and characterizing the nature of neurotropic viruses.',\n 'Recombination in RNA. Abstract The aphthovirus genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA that encodes all the virus-induced proteins. We isolated recombinant aphthoviruses from cells simultaneously infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of two different subtype strains. Analysis of the proteins induced by 16 independently generated recombinants revealed two types of protein pattern, which were consistent with single genetic crossovers on the 5′ side and 3′ side, respectively, of the central P34-coding region. Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins. These fingerprints provide molecular evidence of recombination at the level of RNA and demonstrate the potential of RNA recombination for producing genetic diversity among picornaviruses.',\n 'O-linked oligosaccharides are acquired by herpes simplex virus glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus. Abstract The O-linked oligosaccharides on mature forms of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) glycoproteins were characterized, and were found to account largely for the lower electrophoretic mobilities of these forms relative to the mobilities of immature forms. Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus.',\n 'Microinjection of mRNA coding for an anti-golgi antibody inhibits intracellular transport of a viral membrane protein. Abstract Messenger RNA was prepared from a hybridoma cell line secreting a monoclonal antibody (53FC3) directed against a luminal epitope of a Golgi membrane protein (Mr = 135 kd) found in rodent cells. When this mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells, mouse IgG was seen to accumulate in the Golgi complex after 5–6 hr of incubation. No accumulation was seen in 3T3 cells which lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3. When microinjected BHK cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, surface expression of the viral G protein was considerably reduced when compared with neighboring noninjected cells.',\n 'Identification of a small rna containing the trypanosome spliced leader: A donor of shared 5′ sequences of trypanosomatid mRNAs?. Abstract The 35 nucleotide spliced leader (SL) sequence is found on the 5′ end of numerous trypanosome mRNAs, yet the tandemly organized reiteration units encoding this leader are not detectably linked to any of these structural genes. Here we report the presence of a class of discrete small SL RNA molecules that are derived from the genomic SL reiteration units of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leptomonas collosoma. These small SL RNAs are 135, 105, and 95 nucleotides, respectively, and contain a 5′-terminal SL or SL-like sequence. S1 nuclease analyses demonstrate that these small SL RNAs are transcribed from continuous sequence within the respective SL reiteration units. With the exception of the SL sequence and a concensus donor splice site immediately following it, these small RNAs are not well conserved. We suggest that the small SL RNAs may function as a donor of the SL sequence in an intermolecular process that places the SL at the 5′ terminus of many trypanosomatid mRNAs.',\n 'Trypanosome mRNAs share a common 5′ spliced leader sequence. Abstract A 5′-terminal leader sequence of 35 nucleotides was found to be present on multiple trypanosome RNAs. Based on its representation in cDNA libraries, we estimate that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs contain this leader. This same leader was originally identified on mRNAs encoding the molecules responsible for antigenic variation, variant surface glycoproteins. Studies of selected cDNAs containing this leader sequence revealed that leader-containing transcripts can be stage-specific, stage-regulated, or constitutive. They can be abundant or rare, and transcribed from single or multigene families. No linkage between the genomic leader sequences and the structural gene exons was observed. Possible mechanisms by which the leader sequences are added to trypanosome mRNAs are discussed.',\n \"O-linked oligosaccharides of mouse egg ZP3 account for its sperm receptor activity. Abstract Previously, we reported that ZP3, one of three different glycoproteins present in the mouse egg's zona pellucida, serves as a sperm receptor. Furthermore, small glycopeptides derived from egg ZP3 retain full sperm receptor activity, suggesting a role for carbohydrate, rather than polypeptide chain in receptor function. Here, we report that removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from ZP3 destroys its sperm receptor activity, whereas removal of O-linked oligosaccharides has no effect. A specific size class of O-linked oligosaccharides, recovered following mild alkaline hydrolysis and reduction of ZP3, is shown to possess sperm receptor activity and to bind to sperm. The results presented strongly suggest that mouse sperm bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3.\",\n 'Oligomerization is essential for transport of vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein to the cell surface. Abstract Using ts045, a temperature sensitive strain of Vesicular stomatitis virus, we show that oligomerization of G protein is a prerequisite for its transport from RER to the Golgi apparatus and for its subsequent maturation. While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation.',\n 'The mechanism of RNA recombination in poliovirus. Abstract We have investigated RNA recombination among poliovirus genomes by analyzing both intratypic and intertypic recombinant crosses involving the same defined genetic markers. Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis.',\n 'Evidence for Trans splicing in trypanosomes. Abstract The 5′ ends of trypanosome mRNAs consist of an identical sequence of 35 nucleotides. This “mini-exon” sequence is derived from the 5′ end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 “debranching” extract. We conclude that trnas splicing is the physiological process by which mature mRNA molecules are synthesized in trypanosomes.',\n 'The membrane-spanning segment of invariant chain (Iγ) contains a potentially cleavable signal sequence. Abstract The human invariant chain (Iγ) of class II histocompatibility antigens spans the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum once. It exposes a small amino-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side and a carboxyterminal, glycosylated domain on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. When the exoplasmic domain of Iγ is replaced by the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), CAT becomes the exoplasmic, glycosylated domain of the resulting membrane protein IγCAT∗. Deletion of the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain from IγCAT gives rise to a secreted protein from which an amino-terminal segment is cleaved, most likely by signal peptidase. We conclude that the membrane-spanning region of Iγ contains a signal sequence in its amino-terminal half and that hydrophilic residues at the amino-terminal end of a signal sequence can determine cleavage by signal peptidase.',\n 'Vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by discontinuous synthesis. Abstract We describe the unusual structure of a vaccinia virus late mRNA. In these molecules, the protein-coding sequences of a major late structural polypeptide are preceded by long leader RNAs, which in some cases are thousands of nucleotides long. These sequences map to different regions of the viral genome and in one instance are separated from the late gene by more than 100 kb of DNA. Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch. This demonstrates that vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by tagging the protein-coding sequences onto the 3′ end of other RNAs.',\n 'Discontinuous transcription or RNA processing of vaccinia virus late messengers results in a 5′ poly(A) leader. Abstract We have demonstrated by primer elongation and cap analysis that mature vaccinia virus late transcripts are discontinuously synthesized. We have shown that RNA transcripts from a translocated 11K and from the authentic 11K and 4b late promoters are extended by approximately 35 nucleotides beyond the “start site” determined by S1 mapping using vaccinia genomic DNA as a probe. Sequencing of the RNA and of the first strand cDNA reveal that a homopolymeric poly(A) sequence is linked to the 5′ terminus of the RNA transcripts. S1 mapping of RNA transcripts with a DNA probe containing an A-stretch, replacing promoter sequences upstream of position −1, confirms the existence of a poly(A) leader of approximately 35 A-residues.',\n 'A short sequence in the COOH-terminus makes an adenovirus membrane glycoprotein a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum. Abstract The E19 protein of adenoviruses is a transmembrane protein that abrogates the intracellular transport of class I antigens by forming complexes with them in the ER. We show here that the E19 protein is retained in the ER even in the absence of class I antigens. To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface. Thus, we concluded that a small stretch of amino acids exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane is responsible for the retention of the E19 protein in the ER.',\n 'A trans-spliced leader sequence on actin mRNA in C. elegans. Abstract While determining the 5′ ends of C. elegans actin mRNAs, we have discovered a 22 nucleotide spliced leader sequence. The leader sequence is found on mRNA from three of the four nematode actin genes. The leader also appears to be present on some, but not all, nonactin mRNAs. The actin mRNA leader sequence is identical to the first 22 nucleotides of a novel 100 nucleotide RNA transcribed adjacent, and in the opposite orientation, to the 5S ribosomal gene. The evidence suggests that the actin mRNA leader sequence is acquired from this novel nucleotide transcript by an intermolecular trans-splicing mechanism.',\n 'Signals for ribosomal frameshifting in the rous sarcoma virus gag-pol region. Abstract The gag-pol protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the precursor to the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription and integration, is expressed from two genes that lie in different translational reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting. Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5′ direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.',\n 'Biased hypermutation and other genetic changes in defective measles viruses in human brain infections. Abstract We assessed the alterations of viral gene expression occurring during persistent infections by cloning full-length transcripts of measles virus (MV) genes from brain autopsies of two subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients and one measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) patient. The suquence of these MV genes revealed that, most likely, almost 2% of the nucleotides were mutated during persistence, and 35% of these differences resulted in amino acid changes. One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes.',\n \"ProOmpA is stabilized for membrane translocation by either purified E. coli trigger factor or canine signal recognition particle. Abstract We have isolated large amounts of E. coli outer-membrane protein A precursor (proOmpA). Purified proOmpA is active in membrane assembly, and this assembly is saturable with respect to the precursor protein. A proOmpA-Sepharose matrix allows affinity isolation of trigger factor, a soluble, 63,000 dalton monomeric protein that stabilizes proOmpA in assembly competent form. Comparison of trigger factor's amino-terminal sequence with those in a computer data bank and with those encoded by sec genes, as well as groEL and heat shock gene dnaK, suggests that trigger factor is encoded by a previously undescribed gene. Trigger factor and proOmpA form a 1:1 complex that can be isolated by gel filtration. Purified canine signal recognition particle (SRP) can also stabilize proOmpA for membrane insertion. This post-ribosomal activity of SRP suggests a unifying theme in protein translocation mechanisms.\",\n 'Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus induced in transgenic mice by ectopic expression of class II MHC and interferon-gamma. Abstract We have produced transgenic mouse strains harboring class II major histocompatibility complex or interferon-gamma genes linked to the human insulin promoter. These experiments were designed to investigate the consequences of the expression of immunological effector molecules by nonimmunological cells. In both of these studies we observed the disappearance from the pancreas of the insulin-producing β cells coinciding with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Transgenic mice expressing both chains of the I-A gene showed progressive atrophy of the islets of Langerhans, whereas mice expressing interferon-gamma suffered an inflammatory destruction of the islets.',\n 'Characterization of an efficient coronavirus ribosomal frameshifting signal: Requirement for an RNA pseudoknot. Abstract The genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV contains an efficient ribosomal frameshifting signal at the junction of two overlapping open reading frames. We have defined by deletion analysis an 86 nucleotide sequence encompassing the overlap region which is sufficient to allow frameshifting in a heterologous context. The upstream boundary of the signal consists of the sequence UUUAAAC, which is the likely site of ribosomal slippage. We show by creation of complementary nucleotide changes that the RNA downstream of this “slippery” sequence folds into a tertiary structure termed a pseudoknot, the formation of which is essential for efficient frameshifting.',\n 'Evidence that the leukocyte-common antigen is required for antigen-induced T lymphocyte proliferation. Abstract The leukocyte-common antigen (L-CA) is a family of large molecular weight glycoproteins uniquely expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells of hematopoletic origin. The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA−). The expression of the αβ T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (p55), LFA-1, Thy-1, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA− T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to IL-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen.',\n 'Cell-free protein sorting to the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways. Abstract To elucidate the mechanism of secretory granule formation, we here identify the first intermediate in this process, the immature secretory granule, in the neuroendocrine cell line PC12 and demonstrate the packaging of a regulated secretory protein, secretogranin II, to immature secretory granules in a cell-free system. The formation of immature secretory granules was as fast ( t 1 2 ≈ 5 min ) as that of constitutive secretory vesicles identified by the presence of a rapidly secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using the cell-free system, the formation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was found to be dependent upon ATP. Two distinct populations of vesicles were formed: immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II and constitutive secretory vesicles containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results show that in a cell-free system, a constitutive and a regulated secretory protein are sorted upon exit from the trans-Golgi network.',\n 'A nascent peptide is required for ribosomal bypass of the coding gap in bacteriophage T4 gene 60. Abstract Bacteriophage T4 DNA topoisomerase gene 60 contains a 50 nucleotide untranslated region within the coding sequence of its mRNA. Translational bypass of this sequence by elongating ribosomes has been postulated for the mode of synthesis of an 18 kd polypeptide specified by the split coding segments. Ribosome bypass of the untranslated region also occurs when a segment of gene 60 is fused to lacZ and expressed in E. coli. The efficiency of bypass in these gene 60-lacZ fusions approaches 100%. Here, mutations that delete, insert, or substitute nucleotides from gene 60-lacZ fusions are examined. Essential features necessary for high level gap bypass emerging from this analysis are a cis-acting nascent peptide sequence, a short duplication bordering the gap, and a stop codon contained in a stem-loop structure at the 5′ junction of the gap.',\n 'Ribosomal frameshifting in the yeast retrotransposon Ty: tRNAs induce slippage on a 7 nucleotide minimal site. Abstract Ribosomal frameshifting regulates expression of the TYB gene of yeast Ty retrotransposons. We previously demonstrated that a 14 nucleotide sequence conserved between two families of Ty elements was necessary and sufficient to support ribosomal frameshifting. This work demonstrates that only 7 of these 14 nucleotides are needed for normal levels of frameshifting. Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNALeu UAG and tRNAArg CCU, are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNALeu UAG, an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the +1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNAArg CCU, encoded by a single-copy essential gene. Frameshifting is also directional and reading frame specific. Interestingly, frameshifting is inhibited when the “slip” CUU codon is located three codons downstream, but not four or more codons downstream, of the translational initiation codon.',\n \"A brefeldin A-like phenotype is induced by the overexpression of a human ERD-2-like protein, ELP-1. Abstract Brefeldin A (BFA) is a unique drug affecting the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane traffic and organelle structure. BFA's ability to alter retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) led us to ask whether the ERD-2 retrieval receptor, proposed to return escaped ER resident proteins from the Golgi, might either interfere with or mimic the effects of the drug. When either human ERD-2 or a novel human homolog (referred to as ELP-1) is overexpressed in a variety of cell types, the effects are phenotypically indistinguishable from the addition of BFA. These include the redistribution of the Golgi coat protein, β-COP, to the cytosol, the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle, the mixing of this organelle with the ER, the addition of complex oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and the block of anterograde traffic. Thus, these receptors may provide signals that regulate retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER.\",\n 'Identification of essential components of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore. Abstract We have designed and utilized two in vivo assays of kinetochore integrity in S. cerevisiae. One assay detects relaxation of a transcription block formed at centromeres; the other detects an increase in the mitotic stability of a dicentric test chromosome. ctf13-30 and ctf14-42 were identified as putative kinetochore mutants by both assays. CTF14 is identical to NDC10 CBF2 , a recently identified essential gene that encodes a 110 kd kinetochore component. CTF13 is an essential gene that encodes a predicted 478 amino acid protein with no homology to known proteins. ctf13 mutants missegregate chromosomes at permissive temperature and transiently arrest at nonpermissive temperature as large-budded cells with a G2 DNA content and a short spindle. Antibodies recognizing epitope-tagged CTF13 protein decrease the electrophoretic mobility of a CEN DNA-protein complex formed in vitro. Together, the genetic and biochemical data indicate that CTF13 is an essential kinetochore protein.',\n 'Three-dimensional visualization of the rotavirus hemagglutinin structure. Abstract Three-dimensional structures of a native simian and reassortant rotavirus have been determined by electron cryomicroscopy and computer image processing. The structural features of the native virus confirm that the hemagglutinin spike is a dimer of VP4, substantiated by in vivo radiolabeling studies. Exchange of native VP4 with a bovine strain equivalent results in a poorly infectious reassortant. No VP4 spikes are detected in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the reassortant. The difference map between the two structures reveals a novel large globular domain of VP4 buried within the virion that interacts extensively with the intermediate shell protein, VP6. Our results suggest that assembly of VP4 precedes that of VP7, the major outer shell protein, and that VP4 may play an important role in the receptor recognition and budding process through the rough endoplasmic reticulum during virus maturation.',\n 'Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein. Abstract Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response. Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.',\n 'Autoregulatory frameshifting in decoding mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme. Abstract Rat antizyme gene expression requires programmed, ribosomal frameshifting. A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticulocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base.',\n 'Prevalence of antibodies to specific infectious agents in bovine fetuses from a slaughterhouse in Minnesota. Abstract Sera from 486 bovine fetuses, approximately 60 to 270 days of gestation, were collected at slaughter and tested for the presence of immunoglobulins (Ig). One hundred ten (27%) of the sera were positive for IgG and/or IgM. The earliest age at which fetuses tested positive for IgM and IgG was estimated to be 100 and 120 days, respectively. Ig concentration increased with increased age of the fetus. Sera that were positive for Ig were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to five different infectious agents. Bovine parvovirus antibodies were found in 99 of 110 sera (90%) by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, only 35 (31.8%) of these sera were positive by serum neutralization (SN) test. Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were detected in 30 sera (27%) by HI test and in 20 sera (18%) by SN test. Five (4%) sera contained SN antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Only one (0.9%) serum sample contained SN antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus. None of the sera had antibodies against five Leptospira spp. Results of this study suggest that bovine parvovirus may be a potential cause of reproductive problems in cattle.',\n 'Embryo importation and cryobanking strategies for laboratory animals and wildlife species. Abstract The transportation of embryos obtained from animal models, endangered species and nondomestic farmed animals (e.g., deer) can reduce/eliminate the need for shipping postnatal animals and thus has gained the interest of the biomedical and conservation fields. Efficient movement of germ plasm worldwide requires established cryobanks. Embryo cryopreservation has become a routinely successful technology for many species and efforts to develop usable cryobanks for many target species are ongoing. Recommended regulations for the movement of embryos from nontraditional (i.e. other than domestic livestock) species are nonexistent. Efforts are underway to establish domestic and international handling guidelines and to recommend suitable quarantine conditions to facilitate embryo importation. Further basic research on specific zona pellucida-pathogen interactions is encouraged to support embryo movement efforts.',\n 'Toxicological implications of extended space flights. Abstract The dominant reason for exposing humans to the risks of space flight is their ability to perform complex tasks and make complex decisions. To fulfill such a role, crews must be shielded against even incipient degradation of performance capacity. The space environment contains potential hazardsranging from microgravity to infectious microorganisms to chemical toxicants. An extensive literature indicates that incipient disruptions of function may occur at low levels of exposure to toxic agents and degrade performance. Such questions need to be pursued before irreversible decisions are made about space vehicle design.',\n \"Lymphocytic sialadenitis of Sjögren's syndrome associated with chronic hepatitis C virus liver disease. Abstract Viral infection has often been suggested as a possible cause of Sjögren's syndrome or chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, and Epstein-Barr virus has been found in the salivary glands of patients with this condition. After we had noted Sjögren's syndrome in several patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a virus also excreted in saliva, we set up a prospective study to investigate the association of chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, with or without symptoms, to chronic HCV liver disease. The histological appearances of labial salivary glands in patients with proven HCV hepatitis or cirrhosis were compared with those in dead controls. Histological changes characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome were significantly more common in HCV-infected patients (16 of 28, 57%) compared with controls (1 of 20, 5%). Focal lymphocytic sialadenitis characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome (though only 10 patients had xerostomia and none complained of xerophthalmia) appears to be common in patients with chronic HCV liver disease; if this association is confirmed, identification of the underlying mechanism may improve our understanding of both disorders.\",\n 'High serum procalcitonin concentrations in patients with sepsis and infection. Abstract High concentrations of calcitonin-like immunoreactivity have been found in the blood of patients with various extrathyroid diseases. By means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with various bacterial and viral infections. 79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital with suspected infections were investigated prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial infections had very high serum concentrations of procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6-53 ng/mL) in comparison with 21 children found to have no signs of infection (baseline concentrations <0·1 ng/mL). Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0·1-1·5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0·1-120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin concentrations were found. Concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic conditions. Serum concentrations seem to be correlated with the severity of microbial invasion.',\n 'Quantitative determination of lymphocyte ACTH1–39. Abstract A method was developed for quantitative measurement of ACTH1–39, produced by human lymphocytes. It was shown that pH adjustment to 2 was essential for processing of the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Linearity between time of incubation and ACTH production was shown. The existence of specific endopeptidases in lymphocytes for processing of the POMC molecule remains doubtful.',\n 'The potential use of thalidomide in the therapy of graft-versus-host disease—A review of clinical and laboratory information. Abstract This article reviews the historical development of thalidomide as an immunosuppressive agent and the current state of knowledge of thalidomide as an anti-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) agent. The evidence suggests that metabolites of thalidomide act at an early stage in the antigen recognition-activation pathway of graft T lymphocytes and down regulate normal lymphocyte responses. This effect seems to have beneficial effects in both acute and chronic GVHD, but the optimal mode of use in the clinical setting remains to be determined.',\n 'Epigenetic transmission of feline infectious peritonitis. Abstract Feline Infectious Peritonitis (F.I.P.) was diagnosed in the kittens of two successive litters born to a female presumed also infected. At the same time, the two fathers and the other subjects of the cattery remained asymptomatic of F.I.P. The clinical observations, supported by electrophoretic data, suggest the possibility of a direct transmission of the disease by the mother to her offspring, either by the transplacentary pathway (epigenetic transmission) or via the milk.',\n 'Viral intestinal infections of animals and man. Abstract The extensive use of negative staining techniques and electron microscopy in diagnostic centers has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of reported viral enteric infections in man and animals in the last 10 yr. Enteric infection due to adenoviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, parvoviruses, picornaviruses (caliciviruses), rotaviruses as well as some unidentified viral particles are described. The brief literature review on each of these virus families is supplemented with clinical cases submitted to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. Comparative aspects of viral infections between different animal species as well as man are discussed wherever possible.',\n 'Laboratory techniques of veterinary clinical immunology: A review. Abstract Laboratory tests currently used or easily applicable in veterinary clinical immunology were reviewed in the following three categories: (1) tests detecting disorders in humoral immune response: serum protein screening tests, gammaglobulin estimation and complement testing: (2) tests detecting disorders in cellular immune response: phagocyte function tests and lymphocyte function tests; (3) tests detecting autoimmune disorders: detection of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, autoimmune hemolytic diseases, and autoimmune organ and tissue disorders. The principles of the tests and the interpretations of the results are presented with the appropriate references.',\n 'Antibody-mediated enhancement of disease in feline infectious peritonitis: Comparisons with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Abstract Non-immune kittens passively immunized with feline serum containing high-titered antibodies reactive with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) developed a more rapid disease after FIPV challenge than did kittens pretreated with FIPV antibody-negative serum. Antibody-sensitized, FIPV challenged—kittens developed earlier clinical signs (including pyrexia, icterus, and thrombocytopenia) and died more rapidly than did non-sensitized, FIPV-challenged kittens. Mean survival time in sensitized kittens was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to non-sensitized kittens (mean ± SEM, 10.0 ± 0.6 days vs. 28.8 ± 8.3 days, respectively). Lesions induced included fibrinous peritonitis, disseminated pyogranulomatous inflammation and necrotizing phlebitis and periphlebitis. FIPV antigen, immunoglobulin G, complement (C3) and fibrinogen were demonstrated in lesions by immunofluorescence microscopy. The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in persons bears striking resemblance to that of FIP in experimental kittens. In both FIP and DHF, non-neutralizing antibody may promote acute disease by enhancement of virus infection in mononuclear phagocytes or by formation of immune complexes, activation of complement and secondary vascular disturbances.',\n 'Viral diarrhea of young animals: A review. Abstract A brief presentation is given of the enteric viral infections of young animals. The general characteristics of rotaviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses are reported, and the different aspects of the diseases associated with these viruses are discussed. Certain suggestions are made regarding the prevention of these diseases.',\n \"Evolution des anticorps anti rota dans le lait de vaches traitees en fin de gestation soit par le vaccin anti rota complet, soit par l'adjuvant seul. Résumé Les auteurs ont observé que les anticorps SN (neutralisants), IFI (Immunofluorescence indirecte) et ID (Immunodiffusion) anti-Rota sont excrétés à un haut niveau dans le lait après vaccination des vaches à l'aide d'un vaccin Rota adjuvé, administré 3 semaines avant la mise-bas avec un rappel au moment du part. L'excrétion se maintient pendant au moins trois mois à un niveau se situant entre 10 et 50% du taux colostral. Ce travail confirme également la stimulation aspécifique de l'excretion d'anticorps anti-Rotavirus dans le lait par l'inoculation de la seule fraction adjuvante du vaccin. Cette excrétion est cependant moindre que celle induite par la vaccination à l'aide d'un vaccin anti-Rotavirus. Abstract The authors describe the evolution of the secretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies vaccine given three weeks before and repeated at the moment of parturition. Rota virus antibodies were detected at a high level during the three months test period with the Indirect Immunofluorescence Test, the seroneutralisation test and the immunofluorescence test. The four untreated animals excreted only rota-antibodies till day 6 post partum. Seroneutralising antibodies were detected in the milk of the vaccinated animals at a level of 10–50% of the colostral level till day 90. The aspecific stimulation of the excretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies in the milk after inoculation of the only adjuvant fraction of the vaccine is confirmed. The excretion level, however, was significantly lower than after Rotavirus vaccination.\",\n 'Transmissibility of the contagious equine metritis organism for the cat. Abstract A group of SPF cats were moderately susceptible to the causal organism of contagious equine metritis (CEM) following intra-uterine or intrapreputial challenge with an Irish streptomycin resistant strain isolated from a clinically infected mare. Subclinical infections were established in only 50% of the cats, none of which became long-term carriers of the organism. Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism were essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sero-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal iliac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results. The findings of this study, although establishing the transmissibility of the CEM organism for the cat, demonstrate the limited value of this species as an experimental model system for the disease in the horse.',\n \"Le macrophage alveolaire de porc: Revue bibliographique. Résumé Après une présentation des techniques de récolte des macrophages alvéolaires par lavage pulmonaire réalisé post mortem ou sur porc anesthésié, plusieurs aspects caractéristiques de ces cellules sont décrits: adhérence in vitro, colorations enzymatiques et morphologie, phagocytose. L'étude du porcelet nouveau-né montre que les macrophages alvéolaires apparaissent au cours de la première semaine de vie. Enfin sont présentés les résultats ayant trait aux aspects immunologiques de ces cellules et à leurs interactions complexes avec les agents infectieux. Abstract Following a presentation of different methods used to collect alveolar macrophages by lung washing performed on killed or anaesthetized animals, several main features of these cells are described: in vitro adherence, enzymatic properties and morphology, phagocytosis. Studies of postnatal development show that swine alveolar macrophages appear during the first week of age. Finally, the alveolar macrophage immunological behaviour (surface receptors, cytotoxicity, co-operation with lymphocytes, activation) and the complex micro-organisms—macrophages inter-relationships are discussed.\",\n \"Clinical results obtained in cattle and swine by means of biological immunostimulators. Abstract The conditioned infections due to opportunistic organisms, can be controlled by biological immunostimulators. The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. coli and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7–10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN. In our opinion the activity of the POLI-IF is bound to 3 factors at least: activation of the complementary fractions, mobilization of the immunocompetent cells, induction of IFN.\",\n \"Standardization and kinetics of in vitro bovine blood lymphocyte stimulation with bovine rotavirus. Abstract Two groups of 3-month old calves were immunized intramuscularly with attenuated bovine rotavirus and boosted 21 and 42 days later. The first group of three calves were vaccinated with live virus emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and the second group was immunized with live virus suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Three other calves, serving as controls, were inoculated with PBS emulsified with IFA. The specific cell-mediated and antibody responses of the animals were studied. Preliminary analysis of in vitro peripheral blood lymphocyte transformation to bovine rotavirus determined optimal conditions as: 96 h culture period, 5 × 105 cells per culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine fetal serum and the use of inactivated virus in the cell culture at a concentration of 5 × 106 median tissue culture infective dose before inactivation. Specific blastic stimulation was observed on calves immunized with the rotavirus emulsified with IFA after the second and third vaccine inoculation with stimulation index values varying from 2.00 to 5.73. Serum neutralizing antibody titers of 1 25,600 were also induced in the same calves. Calves immunized with rotavirus-PBS suspension developed a mean antibody titer of 1 1,600 , but showed no specific lymphocyte stimulation. No increase in specific immune responses was detected in the control animals.\",\n 'Neonatal calf diarrhea induced by rotavirus. Abstract This presentation summarizes the results of a comprehensive study on rotaviruses isolated in Italy from calves and rabbits affected by neonatal diarrhea. The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.',\n 'Vaccination of pregnant cows with K99 antigen of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and protection by colostrum in newborn calves. Abstract The immune response to the K99 was tested in 45 pregnant cows, subcutaneously vaccinated, for protecting the newborn calves. Serological tests were performed in the blood sera of all animals and in the milk and colostrum sera; hemogram, inhibition of the adhesion to the brush border and histological tests were performed. The calves from vaccinated cows survived the experimental infection after the suction of colostrum in spite of the fact that the calves from control dams died with diarrhea.',\n \"Consequences pathologiques d'un episode grippal severe (virus swine A/H1N1 dans les conditions naturelles chez la truie non immune en debut de gestation. Résumé L'apparition subite et généralisée de manifestations de fièvre, d'anorexie et de toux sur un groupe de truies nullipares dans un élevage dont les animaux sont par ailleurs l'objet d'un protocole d'étude, a justifié la mise en place d'un dispositif particulier d'observation. Les signes cliniques sont enregistrés quotidiennement et notamment la température rectale. Une cinétique sérologique est réalisée et les anticorpos anti Aujeszky, coronavirus GET-like, grippe, A/H1N1, grippe A/H3N2 et Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae sont recherchés. Des recherches virales sont conduites sur mucosités nasales d'animaux en hyperthermie ainsi que sur avortons. L'étude clinique montre une hyperthermie plus ou moins prononcée sur les animaux, les troubles persistant généralement 2 à 5 jours. Le diagnostic de grippe mettant en cause le virus H1N1 swine apparenté A/FIN/1/82 a été établi à la fois par la sérologie (séroconversion) et la mise en évidence du virus sur écouvillon nasal ainsi que sur avorton. L'examen des poumons de truies réformées après l'épisode grippal montre des lésions étendues de Bronchopneumonie et Pasteurella multocida est mise en évidence. Les conséquences zootechniques ont été considérables en particulier chez les truies venant d'être mises à la reproduction. Ainsi sur 13 truies inséminées depuis moins d'une semaine, 3 mise bas seulement on été obtenues. Elles comportent 5,5 et 12 porcelets. 7 truies sont revenues en chaleurs et enfin 3 diagnostiquées vides à 21 jours par échotomographie ont été réformées et examinées à l'abattoir. Sur 8 truies inséminées depuis environ un mois et confirmées gestantes, 2 résorptions embryonnaires sont intervenues, les 6 autres truies donnant naissance à des portées normales. Enfin sur 18 truies gestantes de plus de 45 jours, un avortement a été observé. Abstract Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41°C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows “not in pig” and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 “not a pig” at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows.

Abstract Monoclonal antibodies have been produced against the 81/36F strain of rotavirus. One of them, was chosen as diagnostic reagent: it showed high ELISA reactivity with all the bovine, human and porcine rotavirus strains tested and reacted with VP6, structural protein product known to support the common rotavirus antigen. A sandwich ELISA procedure using the chosen monoclonal as “capture and detecting” antibody was performed to detect rotavirus in faecal samples from experimentally inoculated newborn calves: it always gave a negative response with meconium and a positive response for the stool specimens which rotavirus have been isolated. This assay was compared with Enzygnost and Slidex Rota Kit tests and with a non-commercial sandwich ELISA test using polyclonal antibodies: it showed more sensitivity than the agglutination test and was as sensitive as the other two tests to detect rotavirus in routine diagnostic material. The test evaluated showed no equivocal results.',\n 'An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using canine coronavirus-infected CRFK cells as antigen for detection of anti-coronavirus antibody in cat. Abstract From the reasons that canine coronavirus (CCV) grows more efficiently than feline coronavirus in a cell culture and they are mutually related in their antigenicities, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using CCV-infected feline kidney (CRFK) cells as substrate antigens was developed for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in cats. It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.',\n 'Coronaviridae, pathogenetic and clinical aspects: An update. Abstract A review is given about pathogenetic and clinical aspects of the well-known as well as of recently detected members of the family Coronaviridae. Special attention is paid to coronavirus infections of domestic cattle and pets, whereas avian, murine, rat and human coronaviruses are summarized briefly.',\n 'BHV1 infections: Relevance and spread in Europe. Abstract Infections caused by BHV1 are very common in Europe, but the disease pattern is quite different: the diseases of the genital tract are most common, those of the respiratory tract vary in intensity and prevalence. Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency. Eradication programmes in Austria, Denmark and Switzerland have removed most of the seropositive cattle from the bovine populations. Currently a sanitary programme is also being conducted in Germany.',\n 'Effects of pseudorabies virus infection upon cytotoxicity and antiviral activities of porcine alveolar macrophages. Abstract Alveolar macrophages (AM) infected with Pseudorabies virus (PRV) were compared to noninfected AM for cytotoxicity against foreign or transformed cells and production of interferon (IFN). Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID50/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/106 cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific 51Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.',\n 'Feline immune system. Abstract Immunological features of feline lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, monocytes/macrophages, cytokines, major histocompatibility complex and delayed-type hypersensitivity are reviewed. Attention is given to the comparison of the feline immune system with the immune systems of humans and other animals. Also presented is information on the modification of feline immunity by pathogens.',\n 'Optimization of culture conditions for feline × murine heterohybridomas. Abstract Feline splenocytes were fused to the murine myeloma lines NSO or Ag8. Autologous serum and taurine were used as media supplements for the cat × mouse heterohybridomas. The best results were obtained by the use of NSO as fusion line with taurine-supported media.',\n 'Studies on the survival of aerosolized bovine rotavirus (UK) and a murine rotavirus. Abstract The effect of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on the survival of airborne bovine rotavirus UK isolate (BRV-UK) and a murine rotavirus (MRV) was studied. In any one experiment, the virus under test was suspended in tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) supplemented with uranine (physical tracer) and an antifoam, was aerosolized using a Collison nebulizer into the rotating drum with the RH at either low (30 ± 5%), medium (50 + 5%) or high (80 ± 5%) level at 20 ± 1°C. Following a 15-min period of viral aerosol stabilization, sequential samples of drum air were collected using an All-Glass Impinger (AGI) for 24 h post-aerosolization. Both of the rotavirus isolates were found to survive best at medium RH level and high RH was found least favorable for the survival of these aerosolized rotaviruses. The survival pattern of aerosolized MRV was found to be the best when compared with survival pattern of all animal and human rotavirus isolates studies performed under aerosolized conditions in our laboratory. The findings of these experiments confirm and extend our previous reports on the survival of other animal and human aerosolized rotaviruses and emphasize the fact that air may be one of the vehicles for their dissemination and could explain why it is difficult to control nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to keep animal colonies rotavirus-free.',\n 'Molecular determinants of rotavirus virulence: Localization of a potential virulence site in a murine rotavirus VP4. Abstract The molecular basis of pathogenesis in vivo for a virulent mouse rotavirus (MRV) and a less virulent bovine rotavirus (BRV) were compared under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Obvious differences in the mobility of several genomic RNA segments were observed in one-dimensional gels. Under in vitro conditions, partial proteolytic peptide mapping identified differences between the two outer capsid proteins of these virus and no difference in inner capsid protein was observed. Since it has been observed by us and others that the gene coding for VP4 protein plays a significant role in determining virulence, the variability observed in the present study between the 84 k proteins (VP4) provided a basis for further investigations in order to locate a potential virulence determinant. A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts. Like their parents, BRV and MRV isolates, reassortants obtained by replacement of gene 4 in BRV with MRV gene 4 indicated that the dose of the virus isolate used and the clinical outcome in vivo was determined by gene segment 4. The implications of these findings to elucidate the molecular basis of pathogenesis of rotaviruses are discussed.',\n \"Cellular immune status of coronavirus-infected neonatal calves. Abstract A preliminary study was conducted to determine the cellular immune status of neonatal, colostrum-deprived calves following inoculation with either attenuated or virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV). Uninfected calves served as controls. To determine the intestinal and systemic cellular immune status, we performed MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) assay on mesenteric lymphocytes, enumerated T cell subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and examined histopathological alterations in mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes. These calves developed intestinal antibody responses in the acute phase of infection (1 week after infection) but were immunosuppressed in the later stage of infection.\",\n 'Antibody responses in spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum of bovine coronavirus-infected neonatal calves. Abstract A preliminary study was conducted to compare the regional intestinal immune responses of neonatal calves inoculated with virulent or attenuated bovine coronavirus (BCV) to determine the cause of reported vaccine failures. A group of 9 newborn, colostrum-deprived calves was used; two calves were inoculated with attenuated virus, four calves were infected with virulent virus (including one naturally infected calf), and three calves were uninfected controls. Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins. The antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon. The immune responses developed slowly in jejunum and were associated primarily with the IgG subtypes.',\n 'Studies on the suitability of alpha-hybrid interferon application in cattle. Abstract Twelve cattle with body wts ranging from 100 to 250 kg were treated using various doses and routes for four days with an E. coli derived alpha-hybrid interferon. The lowest parenteral doses (104 units per kg body wt) and the orally administered interferon did not lead to any disturbances, whereas the higher dosages led to marked changes in body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. Animals with the highest dose (108 units per kg body wt) became extremely distressed. The blood picture showed distinct changes, with very low leukocyte counts during treatment, which took weeks to recover. It is suggested that the dosages that did not lead to clinical symptoms are best suited for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.',\n 'A model for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection based on experimental aerosol exposure with bovine RSV in calves. Abstract Five conventionally kept calves aged between 17 and 24 days were experimentally infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) by aerosol in order to mimic the natural infection route. The calves were killed and autopsies performed 7 days after the first virus challenge. The BRSV isolate used induced tracheitis, bronchitis and atelectasis in infected calves. The only virus which could be isolated from the lungs of the calves was BRSV. In addition, Mycoplasma bovirhinis was isolated from the lung or/and trachea of two calves. The clinical and histopathological findings, as well as the detection of BRSV antigens by immunofluorescence in the epithelial cells of lung and trachea, and the reisolation of the virus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of all inoculated calves, provided confirmation of successful infection with BRSV.',\n 'Prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses in the feces of neonatal dairy calves from California. Abstract 136 fecal samples, collected from 47 dairy calves on a calf ranch and in a dairy herd in California, were tested for the presence of group A and group B rotaviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses. Group B and short and long electropherotype group A rotaviruses were found in both normal and diarrheic calves.',\n 'Daptomycin: A cyclic lipopeptide antimicrobial agent. Abstract Objectives: The aims of this article were: to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy ofdaptomycin; to explore its safety profile; and to discuss its current and potential roles as an antimicrobial therapy. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. Results: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. Conclusions: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses >4 mg/kg QD.',\n 'Antigenicity of the peplomer protein of infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract To study the antigenic structure of the peplomer protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, fragments from the peplomer gene were generated by restriction-enzyme cleavage or by limited DNase digestion and inserted in the Escherichia coli expression plasrnid pEX (Stanley and Luzio, 1984). The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system. The relevance of our finclings for vaccine development is discussed.',\n 'Rapid and accurate viral diagnosis. Abstract In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the importance of viral infections. In addition, new antiviral agents have become available. These factors have led to a marked increase in utilization of viral diagnositc services. In this review, both conventional and rapid methods for viral diagnosis are presented, with emphasis on recent advances. The antiviral agents currently available and the major drugs under investigation are also briefly discussed. It is hoped that this review will serve as a useful adjunct for the management of patients with virus infections.',\n 'Hepatic circulation: Potential for therapeutic intervention. Abstract In recent years, knowledge of the physiology and pharmacology of hepatic circulation has grown rapidly. Liver microcirculation has a unique design that allows very efficient exchange processes between plasma and liver cells, even when severe constraints are imposed upon the system, i.e. in stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been recognized recently that sinusoids and their associated cells can no longer be considered only as passive structures ensuring the dispersion of molecules in the liver, but represent a very sophisticated network that protects and regulates parenchymal cells through a variety of mediators. Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals. Although it is not clear whether vascular lesions can be the primary events that lead to hepatocyte injury, the main interest of these findings is that liver microcirculation could represent a potential target for drug action in these conditions.',\n \"Human natural interferon-α producing cells. Abstract Interferons (IFNs) are critical components of the host immune system, serving as antiviral agents, immunomodulators and inhibitors of cell growth. Among peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the primary IFN-α-producing cell is a light density, HLA-DR+ cell negative for cell surface markers typical for T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural-killer or progenitor cells and has been tentatively the ‘natural’ IFN-producing cell' or NIPC. Although present in very low frequency (approximately 1:1000 among peripheral blood mononuclear cells), the NIPC are very potent, with an individual cell able to produce 1–2 IU of IFN. In this review, the characteristics, phenotype, regulation and relationship of NIPC to human disease are discussed.\",\n 'Liver cytoprotection by prostaglandins. Abstract During the last decade intensive work on the relationships between the liver and the arachidonic acid cascade has greatly expanded our knowledge of this area of research. The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE2, PGE1, PGI2 and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models. The therapeutic usefulness of PGs in clinical practice is critically analyzed on the basis of available evidence in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and primary graft nonfunction following liver transplantation.',\n 'Picornavirus inhibitors. Abstract Picornaviruses are among the best understood animal viruses in molecular terms. A number of important human and animal pathogens are members of the Picornaviridae family. The genome organization, the different steps of picornavirus growth and numerous compounds that have been reported as inhibitors of picornavirus functions are reviewed. The picornavirus particles and several agents that interact with them have been solved at atomic resolution, leading to computer-assisted drug design. Picornavirus inhibitors are useful in aiding a better understanding of picornavirus biology. In addition, some of them are promising therapeutic agents. Clinical efficacy of agents that bind to picornavirus particles has already been demonstrated.',\n 'Evaluation of the role of exogenous pathogens on the incidence of embryo loss during early pregnancy in mice. Abstract The mating of CBA/j♀ mice (H2k) by DBA/2j♂ mice (H2d) typically results in an elevated incidence of spontaneous embryo loss thus providing an ideal genetically controlled laboratory model for the study of the factors causing early embryo loss during pregnancy. There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.',\n 'Serum antibody responses of neonatal and young adult pigs to transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. Abstract Serum titers of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody were 10 to 16 times higher in neonatal pigs than in young adult pigs, after single oral doses of virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). To determine the reason for this higher response, sera from neonatal and young adult pigs, 18 to 21 days after exposure to TGEV, were collected and assayed for VN antibody by plaque reduction. In addition, sera of VN-positive and VN-negative neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodiffusion technique. The competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated. The higher antibody response seen in neonatal pigs, when compared to sera of young adult pigs, may be attributed to the increased replication of TGEV in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs or to the lack of other immunogens that may interfere or compete with the production of specific antibody.',\n 'Application of radioimmunological methods for checking the quality of class-specific antibodies against bovine and porcine immunoglobulins. Abstract Class-specific antibodies against bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM and IgA and porcine IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins were prepared. Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, namely, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highly specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normal serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.',\n 'Comparison of the blastogenic response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from canine parvovirus-positive and -negative outbred dogs. Abstract Lymphocyte blast transformation assays (LBT) were performed on canine parvovirus (CPV) -positive and -negative mongrel dogs randomly selected from a humane facility. Concanavalin A as well as Phytohemagglutinin P stimulation was depressed (p<0.001) in the group of animals shedding CPV compared to CPV-negative dogs.',\n 'Intestinal antibody response after vaccination and infection with rotavirus of calves fed colostrum with or without rotavirus antibody. Abstract The intestinal and systemic antibody response of calves vaccinated and/or challenged with rotavirus was studied employing isotype-specific ELISAs for the detection of IgG1, IgG2, IgM and IgA antibodies to rotavirus. Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.',\n 'Possible immunoenhancement of persistent viremia by feline leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein vaccines in challenge-exposure situations where whole inactivated virus vaccines were protective. Abstract Kittens immunized with purified native FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 envelope proteins developed ELISA, but not virus neutralizing, antibodies in their serum to both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70. Kittens vaccinated with envelope proteins and infected with feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) developed smaller tumors than nonvaccinates, but a greater incidence of persistent retroviremia. Similarly, FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 vaccinated kittens were more apt to become persistently retroviremic following virulent FeLV challenge exposure than nonvaccinates. Kittens vaccinated with inactivated whole FeLV developed smaller tumors after FeSV inoculation and had a lower incidence of persistent retroviremia than nonvaccinates. The protective effect of inactivated whole FeLV vaccine against persistent retroviremia was also seen with FeLV challenge-exposed cats. Protection afforded by inactivated whole FeLV vaccine was not associated with virus neutralizing antibodies, although ELISA antibodies to both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70 were induced by vaccination.',\n 'Bovine monoclonal antibodies to the F5 (K99) pilus antigen of E. coli, produced by murine/bovine hybridomas. Abstract Lymph node cells from calves immunized with purified pilus antigen of K99+ enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were fused with mouse myeloma (NSO) cells, and with non-Ig producing mouse/calf hybridomas or with a bovine Ig-producing mouse/calf/calf secondary hybridoma. Lines secreting bovine monoclonal IgG1 specific for K99 pilus antigen in an ELISA were obtained in each case. The two lines derived from xenohybridoma fusion partners have been secreting anti-K99 bovine monoclonal antibody for over one year in continual passage. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with other pilus types including K88, CFAI, CFAII, 987P or CP; they all inhibited agglutination of horse RBC (which have a K99 receptor) in the presence of K99 antigen; they showed positive fluorescence in an indirect binding assay on K99+ ETEC and inhibited K99+ ETEC adhesion to piglet enterocytes. These antibodies have potential prophylactic and therapeutic use in control and treatment of diarrhoea.',\n 'The application of hybridoma technology to the study of bovine immunoglobulins. Abstract Studies are described in which hybridoma technology is used to produce a variety of reagents for the characterization and manipulation of the bovine humoral immune system. Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics. Some of the ways in which monoclonal anti-idiotypes in particular, and monoclonal in general, might be of use in problems of animal disease are discussed.',\n 'The transfer of serum IgG1 antibody into the gastrointestinal tract in newborn calves. Abstract Transfer of functional blood IgG1 to the gastrointestinal tract was measured in neonatal calves. Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.',\n 'Development of nasal, fecal and serum isotype-specific antibodies in calves challenged with bovine coronavirus or rotavirus. Abstract Unsuckled specific pathogen free calves were inoculated at 3–4 weeks of age, either intranasally (IN) or orally (O) with bovine coronavirus or O plus IN (O/IN) or O with bovine rotavirus. Shedding of virus in nasal or fecal samples, and virus-infected nasal epithelial cells were detected using immunofluorescent staining (IF), ELISA or immune electron microscopy (IEM). Isotype-specific antibody titers in sera, nasal and fecal samples were determined by ELISA. Calves inoculated with coronavirus shed virus in feces and virus was detected in nasal epithelial cells. Nasal shedding persisted longer in IN-inoculated calves than in O-inoculated calves and longer than fecal shedding in both IN and O-inoculated calves. Diarrhea occurred in all calves, but there were no signs of respiratory disease. Calves inoculated with rotavirus had similar patterns of diarrhea and fecal shedding, but generally of shorter duration than in coronavirus-inoculated calves. No nasal shedding of rotavirus was detected. Peak IgM antibody responess, in most calves, were detected in fecal and nasal speciments at 7–10 days post-exposure (DPE), preceeding peak IgA responses which occurred at 10–14 DPE. The nasal antibody responses occurred in all virus-inoculated calves even in the absence of nasal shedding of virus in rotavirus-inoculated calves. Calves inoculated with coronavirus had higher titers of IgM and IgA antibodies in fecal and nasal samples than rotavirus-inoculated calves. In most inoculated calves, maximal titers of IgM or IgA antibodies correlated with the cessation of fecal or nasal virus shedding. A similar sequence of appearance of IgM and IgA antibodies occurred in serum, but IgA antibodies persisted for a shorter period than in fecal or nasal samples. Serum IgG1 antibody responses generally preceeded IgG2 responses and were predominant in most calves after 14–21 DPE.',\n 'Rapid detection of viral-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Abstract The development of three separate rapid ELISAs for detecting antibodies in host serum to three different viruses is described. These include: 1. 1.|A direct antigen assay using enzyme labelled anti-canine Ig for detecting antibodies to canine parvovirus, 2. 2.|A competitive ELISA using a feline infectious peritonitis virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with enzyme, and 3. 3.|A competitive ELISA using an equine infectious anemia virus-specific monoclonal antibody and enzyme labelled antigen, p. 26. The utility and benefits of each of the three approaches is emphasized.',\n 'Antiviral and Antigenic Properties of Recombinant Porcine Interferon Gamma. Abstract Recombinant porcine interferon gamma (rPoIFNγ) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the cytopathic effect produced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of both homologous and heterologous (bovine) cell lines. In addition, an antiviral effect of rPoIFNγ was demonstrable against the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of porcine epithelial cells and of pulmonary macrophages. A rabbit anti-PoIFNγ antiserum was prepared and shown to specifically neutralize the antiviral effects of natural and recombinant porcine IFNγ preparations. This antiserum could also neutralize recombinant bovine IFNγ but not recombinant human IFNγ. These results suggest antigenic homology of porcine and bovine IFNγ but antigenic differences between these molecules and human IFNγ.',\n 'A Bovine Monoclonal Antibody to Oestrone/Oestradiol Prepared by a (Murine×Bovine) ×Bovine Interspecies Fusion. Abstract A heterohybridoma was produced by the fusion of sensitized peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with a previously derived heteromyeloma, generated by the fusion of bovine PBLs with murine myeloma cells. The sensitized bovine PBLs were collected from a steer immunized with an oestradiol-ovalbumin conjugate. The cell lines resulting from the fusion were screened for the production of bovine antibodies to oestradiol. A stable heterohybridoma was isolated which secreted a bovine IgG1 to oestrone/oestradiol. The use of sensitized PBLs together with heteromyeloma fusion partners has proved to be a reliable and simple way of producing monoclonal antibodies against specific haptens.',\n 'Isolation and characterization of lymphocytes from bovine intestinal epithelium and lamina propria. Abstract The lymphocyte populations of the bovine gut lamina proprial (LP) and epithelial tissues were isolated and characterized with respect to cells bearing surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig). Functional characteristics of cells from the two tissues, including responsiveness to Concanavalin A (Con A), anti-bovine immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), Con A supernatants of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (bConA sup) and recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2), were also assessed. Less than 1% of the mononuclear cells in the epithelial tissue (IEL) stained for cytoplasmic Ig, and 9% stained positively for surface Ig. IEL did not proliferate in response to anti-Ig, although cells of this population did respond to Con A, bConA sup, and rhIL-2. Twenty-seven percent of bovine gut LP lymphocytes stained for surface Ig, while 39% of these cells were positive for cytoplasmic Ig. LP lymphocytes proliferated in response to all four stimulants used, Con A, anti-Ig, bConA sup and rhIL-2.',\n 'Activation of natural killer cells in newborn piglets by interferon induction. Abstract Natural killer (NK) cell activity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of newborn piglets, normally negligible, was stimulated by in vitro treatment with porcine type I interferon (IFN), and the NK activity of PBL from weaned piglets was augmented by the same treatment. Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets. It was concluded that NK cells in newborn piglets can be activated by treatment of the piglets with poly ICLC, and that the presence of active NK cells is associated with some increase in resistance to challenge with TGE virus.',\n 'A review of enzyme immunoassay for detection of antibody to Brucella abortus in cattle. Abstract Enzyme immunoassay has gained wide acceptance for serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis because of its ability to detect antibody of all isotypes unlike the conventional tests. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, however, presents several parameters that require careful analysis. These parameters include the choice of antigen and antiglobulin-enzyme conjugate reagents for use in the assay, dealing with the large amount of data the semi-automatic or automatic assay can generate and the inter-and intralaboratory standardization and quality control. This review considers the various methods described in the literature and, briefly, how some of the problems have been overcome or how they might be dealt with.',\n 'Evaluation of immunity to feline infectious peritonitis in cats with cutaneous viral-induced delayed hypersensitivity. Abstract Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like reactions to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) were induced in the skin of nine cats that were asymptomatic after a previous challenge-exposure with FIPV. Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1–5-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP. Seemingly, DTH responses to FIPV can be associated with an increased level of resistance to disease; however, this state of immunity is variable and apparently can be lost with time in some cats.',\n 'Bovine monoclonal antibody specific for Brucella abortus lipopolysaccharide. Abstract The development of a bovine monoclonal antibody against Brucella abortus smooth lipopolysaccharide (BM-8) by interspecies fusion of bovine peripheral lymphocytes from an immunized cow and a murine plasmacytoma cell line is described. The twice cloned cell line secreted bovine IgG1 subclass antibody. Ascites fluid was prepared in pristane treated nu/nu mice by intraperitoneal injection. The pooled ascites fluid was purified by affinity chromatography and the functions of the antibody assessed in various serological tests. The BM-8 antibody did not agglutinate well at a neutral pH, however, under acid conditions it was efficient at agglutinating B. abortus cells. The antibody did not precipitate B. abortus LPS in double agar gel immunodiffusion but was very active in the direct complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay, although it was unable to compete with a murine monoclonal antibody in a competitive enzyme immunoassay.',\n 'The production and application of non-rodent monoclonal antibodies in veterinary science. Abstract The requirement for monoclonal antibodies derived from species other than rats and mice is becoming increasingly realised in veterinary, as well as human, medicine. This paper reviews current knowledge of the production of inter-species hybridomas (heterohybridomas) by the fusion of rodent myeloma cell lines with lymphocytes from species of veterinary importance. To date a number of monoclonal immunoglobulins derived from sheep, cattle, pig, rabbit, mink and primate species have been produced to a variety of different bacterial, viral and nematode pathogens as well as to blood group and MHC determinants and to hormones. The technique opens up a number of possibilities for the future; some of these applications are discussed in relation to the antibodies produced thus far.',\n 'Natural killer (NK) activity and interferon (IFN) production by a fraction of spleen and blood lymphocytes in swine. Abstract After carbonyl iron treatment and gradient isolation, spleen and blood pig lymphocytes exhibited NK activity and produced IFN after viral induction. Removal of plastic-adherent cells, including the majority of B cells, did not change these activities. The plastic-non-adherent cells were further separated into two subsets of roughly similar size by panning using a monoclonal, anti-T, and anti-null cell antibodies (81+cells). NK activity and IFN production were found in the 81 − cell fraction. A significantly higher proportion of null lymphocytes from blood and of splenic Fc-gamma receptor-bearing lymphocytes was also found among the 81 − cell fraction as compared to the 81 + fraction, without any change among other subsets. Similar proportions of helper (PT4+), cytotoxic (PT8+) and total T cells (MSA4+) were found among lymphocytes bound to target K562 cells and among the whole lymphocyte population. In contrast, lymphocytes that bound K562 cells demonstrated a striking increase in the proportion of Fc-gamma receptor-positive cells of high affinity. These results show that NK cells and IFN-producing cells are mainly included in the same blood and spleen fraction, and suggest that among 81 − cells only those expressing an Fc-gamma receptor of high affinity are active.',\n 'Diseases associated with spontaneous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in cats. Abstract More than 2000 cats sent for necropsy in order to provide a diagnosis were investigated immunohistologically using paraffin sections for the presence of a persistent infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.',\n 'Activated porcine alveolar macrophages: Are biological response modifiers the answer?. Abstract We report that 75% of conventionally housed 3- to 4-week-old swine already have detectable activated alveolar macrophages as measured by cytotoxicity of tumor cells. These macrophages can not be further activated by the biological response modifier N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-2H2O (MDP). These macrophages lose cytotoxic activity when cultured for 24 h and this loss of activity can not be reversed by MDP. We suggest that MDP biological response modifier therapy of swine alveolar macrophages may not be a useful technique in preventing respiratory disease in swine.',\n 'Effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis in cats. Abstract The effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-α) in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free cats. Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10−3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104–102 U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (106 U/kg), moderate dose (104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 106 U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-α given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.',\n 'Recombinant porcine interferon-gamma activates in vitro porcine adherent mononuclear cells to produce interleukin 1. Abstract The effect of recombinant porcine interferon-gamma (rPoIFNγ) on in vitro production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by porcine blood monocytes was studied. Three-day-old cultures of porcine adherent blood mononuclear cells were treated by doses of rPoIFNγ for 3 or 6 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induction. While rPoIFNγ alone had no effect, a combined treatment by rPoIFNγ and LPS enhanced the IL-1 secretory potential of adherent mononuclear cells and, to a lesser extent, the level of cell-associated IL-1. The IL-1 activity was neutralized by anti porcine IL-1 α and β antisera. These results demonstrate that rPoIFNγ has immunomodulatory effects in vitro on porcine monokine production.',\n 'Construction of a bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell line; Production of bovine monoclonal antibodies against rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin. Abstract Bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell lines were prepared by fusing lymphoid cells from a bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected cow with mouse myeloma cells. Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.',\n 'Natural killer cell activity of chicken intraepithelial leukocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells. Abstract Intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL) and splenocytes collected from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against a natural killer (NK) cell-susceptible lymphoblastoid cell line (LSCC-RP9) and against rotavirus-infected chick kidney cells in 4-h chromium-release assays. Both splenocytes and IELs from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenocytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.',\n 'Lactogenic Immunity to Transmissible Gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine induced by the attenuated nouzilly strain of TGE virus: Passive protection of piglets and detection of serum and milk antibody classes by ELISA. Abstract Piglets of eight sows vaccinated by different routes with the attenuated TGE mutant coronavirus, Nouzilly (N) strain, and piglets from two field seropositive sows were challenged with a virulent TGE strain. On the day of challenge and 10 days after challenge, milk and serum samples from sows were analysed for their level of neutralizing antibodies, total immunoglobulin classes and TGE antibody classes by an ELISA. No direct relationship was seen between the level of protection of the litters and the titres of the different antibody classes on the day of challenge. However, an inverse correlation was seen 10 days after challenge between protection and the level of TGE antibodies.',\n 'Natural killer (NK) activity of porcine blood lymphocytes against allogeneic melanoma target cells. Abstract Allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells of Munich Troll® miniature swine have been used for the demonstration of porcine peripheral blood NK cell activity. Compared with the specific lysis of xenogeneic K562-, U937- and Vero-target cells, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NK-CMC) against PM/86 melanoma tumor cells was significantly lower in a 16 h chromium release assay. The target cell susceptibility to pheriperal blood NK-CMC of both adult Troll® miniature swine and German Landrace sows was very similar. Cold target inhibition assays revealed the allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells to be the most powerful inhibitors of NK-CMC. Nylon wool non-adherent lymphocytes produced interferon (IFN)-alpha in different quantities upon contact with NK susceptible target cells. The NK effector cells could lytic activity against all susceptible targets by a moderate dose of natural human inteleukin-2 (nhuIL-2). The role of NK-CMC in melanoma tumor rejection and/or prevention of metastases is yet unknown in swine although porcine melanoma serves as a good model for the disease in man.',\n \"In vitro mitogen responses and lymphocyte subpopulations in cheetahs. Abstract Lack of genetic variability and apparent susceptibility of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to coronavirus infection has lead to speculation that this species may have immune system deficits. To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg+) and Tc (28.7% FT2 +) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg+; 19.0% FT2+). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2+ (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.\",\n 'Swine leukocyte antigen and macrophage marker expression on both African swine fever virus-infected and non-infected primary porcine macrophage cultures. Abstract Swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) and a macrophage specific marker were monitored on porcine macrophages cultured with or without macrophage colony stimulatory factor (M-CSF) and on cells infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV). SLA expression was maximal either in the total cell extract or on the cell surface at 3–4 days of culture; after 4 days these values began to decrease. Fluorescence analyses of immunostained macrophages cultured with or without M-CSF indicated a major upward shift in the number of SLA Class I molecules on individual macrophages whereas for SLA Class II both a novel expression of Class II and an upward shift in the number of molecules per cell were evident. Infection of 3-day-old macrophage cultures with three different isolates of ASFV resulted in minor changes in surface expression of SLA Class I, SLA Class II, and macrophage markers. No differences in infection with ASFV was observed whether macrophages were SLA Class II positive or negative, nor was there blocking by anti-SLA Class I or Class II monoclonal antibodies of ASFV infection of cultured macrophages.',\n 'The effect of dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression on the development of faecal antibody and recovery from and resistance to rotavirus infection. Abstract Rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune gnotobiotic calves were treated with high doses of dexamethasone (DX) to suppress the immune system. Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.',\n 'Clinical and pathological findings in feline immunodeficiency virus experimental infection. Abstract A study is described of the clinical and pathological findings in 20 specific pathogen free cats infected when 1 year old with feline immunodeficiency virus and monitored over 12 months. Cats were divided into two groups (A and B). The clinical and clinicopathological features were studied in Group A. In Group B, at 1, 2, 4, 9 and 12 months post infection two cats were necropsied. Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjunctiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye. One cat developed a lymphosarcoma affecting the liver and kidneys at 36 weeks post infection. The cat with jaundice had a cholangitis with marked biliary epithelial hyperplasia.',\n 'Suppression of bovine lymphocyte responses to mitogens following in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone. Abstract Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg−1 day−1) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2−, CD5+, CD8−, CD4− and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.',\n 'In vitro responses of cheetah mononuclear cells to feline herpesvirus-1 and Cryptococcus neoformans. Abstract In vitro T cell function by domestic cats and cheetahs to two common pathogens, feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) and Cryptococcus neoformans, was assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-1, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays. Therefore, additional mechanisms influence the final outcome of the immune response.',\n 'Age-related increase of porcine natural interferon α producing cell frequency and of interferon yield per cell. Abstract Porcine blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were shown to secrete interferon α (IFN-α) after induction by a coronavirus, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). IFN-α producing cells, referred to as natural interferon α producing (NIP) cells, were detected by an ELISPOT assay using anti-porcine IFN-α monoclonal antibodies. The frequency of NIP cells among blood cells is low, at most 40–110 per 105 PBMC and each NIP cell was found to produce several units of IFN. We have shown that NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell gradually increased with the age of the donor animals, from the neonatal period to the adult age, with a significant increase around puberty. Our present results also indicate that NIP cells may be influenced by physiological and genetic factors; thus (1) NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell were decreased during lactation; (2) Chinese (Meishan) pigs were found to have higher NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell than European (Large White) animals.',\n 'Number and distribution of T lymphocytes in the small intestinal mucosa of calves inoculated with rotavirus. Abstract An understanding of the immune response to rotavirus is needed to develop effective prophylaxis. There is evidence that cell-mediated responses may be involved and to extend these observations, rotavirus antigen and the three major T cell subsets, BoCD4+, BoCD8+, and BoWC1+ γ/δ lymphocytes were immunostained in tissue sections from calves killed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post inoculation and quantified by image analysis. It was established that in control calves, BoCD4+ lymphocytes were predominantly in the lamina propria, while the majority of BoCD8+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ lymphocytes were in the epithelium. Rotavirus infection was seen throughout the small intestine with the greatest amount of viral antigen detected at 4 days post inoculation in the mid and distal small intestine. Increased numbers of all subsets were detected; small increases in intraepithelial BoCD4+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ T lymphocytes were observed especially in the distal small intestine, while larger increases in BoCD8+ cells were detected in the epithelium and lamina propria of the proximal, mid and distal small intestine. The timing and location of these increases in T lymphocyte subsets is indicative of a specific immune response involving BoCD8+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ T lymphocytes.',\n 'Isolation and functional studies on feline bone marrow derived macrophages. Abstract In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture. The bulk of the cultured cell population consists of macrophages as assessed by morphology, macrophage specific cytochemistry, and phagocytosis. The remaining cells were lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts and occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. While resting cells produced no detectable interleukin 1, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of biologically active interleukin 1. After 6 h LPS stimulation, mRNA for tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β was detectable. The absence of mRNA in unstimulated cells indicates cultured macrophages were not activated until stimulated by LPS or plastic adherence. This approach provides a useful means to measure potential modulatory effects by virus infections or other agents upon feline macrophage gene expression.',\n 'Enumeration of isotype-specific antibody-secreting cells derived from gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with porcine rotaviruses. Abstract In order to evaluate mucosal antibody responses to rotavirus, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was adapted to enumerate antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and spleens of gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with porcine rotaviruses (SB1A and Gottfried). Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7–14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14–21. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3–4 week old pigs were higher than those of 3–5 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs. Moreover, our results support the use of gnotobiotic piglets as an animal model to evaluate active antibody responses and protection against rotavirus infection and disease.',\n 'Cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α. Abstract We report the cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α (fTNF-α). Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD50 of 15 ng ml−1 and 230 ng ml−1, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-α-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-α, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-α-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-α receptor and MHC-I antigen expression.',\n 'Oral treatment of transmissible gastroenteritis with natural human interferon alpha: A field study. Abstract During a natural outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), groups of piglets were treated orally for 4 consecutive days with placebo or 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 international units (IU) natural human interferon alpha (nHuIFNα). Piglets that were 1–12 days of age and given 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 IU nHuIFNα had significantly (P < 0.01) greater survival rates than placebo-treated piglets; survival rates were the greater for the highest level of nHuIFNα treatment. In contrast, beneficial effects of nHuIFNα were not observed in piglets farrowed during the disease outbreak and given nHuIFNα within hours of birth. Oral nHuIFNα therapy modulates the natural course of high morbidity and mortality commonly seen with TGE.',\n 'IgM, IgA, IgG1 and IgG2 specific responses in blood and gut secretion of calves fed soyabean products. Abstract Calves fed soya proteins may develop severe gastrointestinal disorders. Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.',\n 'Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 in sera and mucosal secretions of calves after experimental reinfection and after reactivation. Abstract Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) were measured in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of calves that were reinfected with BHV1 and 6 weeks later treated with corticosteroids to reactivate putative latent virus. After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time of reinfection or corticosteroid treatment and the period of virus shedding, suggesting that nasal IgA does not play a major role in protection against reinfection with BHV1.',\n 'Cellular immune responses of pigs after primary inoculation with porcine respiratory coronavirus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus and challenge with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.',\n \"Recombinant FeLV vaccine: long-term protection and effect on course and outcome of FIV infection. Abstract The efficacy and the long-term protection of a recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine were determined in 30 specified pathogen free cats for over 3 years. At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4+ lymphocyte counts. CD8+ lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8high) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8low) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.\",\n 'Genetic variation in parameters reflecting immune competence of swine. Abstract Genetic variation in total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, phagocytic capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), virus induced interferon-α (IFN-α) production, mitogen induced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production of mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro was studied in blood collected from 124 Yorkshire piglets, aged 8 weeks. The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h 2=0.87±0.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h 2=0.3−0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h 2=0.00−0.08±0.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-α production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-α production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN-α production. Despite these positive correlations, no parental offspring group was uniformly superior across all traits measured. However, the heritabilities estimated for the immune parameters are sufficiently high to be used as genetic markers in selection for general immune competence of swine.',\n 'Seroepidemiological and clinical survey of feline immunodeficiency virus infection in northern Italy. Abstract Four hundred and thirty-nine feline serum samples from cats with different living conditions in the north of Italy were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and for antigen of Feline Leukemia Virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A Western blot technique was also used on the positive sera in order to confirm the presence of specific antibodies to FIV. The Western blot enabled the detection of a false positive serum. The prevalence of FIV infection in this population was 12.5% and among the seropositive cats a greater proportion was male (74.5%) than female (25.5%). A correlation between the clinical status and the evolution of the pathology is described together with a score based on the severity of the stomatitis in infected cats. The Western blot patterns of positive samples were then compared with the stage of the pathology. Statistical analysis on the distribution of FIV in stray cats, cats with garden and courtyard access and strictly house-confined cats showed a highly significant risk of the infection in the first group.',\n 'Influence of experimentally induced endogenous production of cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Abstract Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.',\n 'Humoral immune response to Salmonella abortusovis in sheep: in vitro induction of an antibody synthesis from either sensitized or unprimed lymph node cells. Abstract In vitro culture conditions were determined to induce an anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibody synthesis from lymph node leucocytes of three immunized sheep and two unprimed lambs maintained in culture in the presence of heat-inactivated bacteria for 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.',\n 'Immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus infections in swine. Abstract Despite the pioneering efforts to identify correlates of passive immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), effective vaccines for the control of TGE in suckling pigs have remained elusive. The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.',\n 'Vaccination of racing greyhounds: effects on humoral and cellular immunity. Abstract Greyhound kennel owners frequently employ multiple vaccination schedules in an attempt to reduce financial losses incurred as a result of infectious diseases. In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish ‘baseline’ values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter. Results of this study indicate that maximum vaccination schedules do not appear to be more effective or more immunosuppressive than minimum vaccination schedules.',\n 'Immunohistological demonstration of feline infectious peritonitis virus antigen in paraffin-embedded tissues using feline ascites or murine monoclonal antibodies. Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus antigen was demonstrated after methanol, ethanol or formalin fixation in paraffin-embedded tissues by means of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody was induced by immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by purification on protein A-Sepharose of ascites fluid from a cat with FIP. Almost all cats diagnosed as suffering from FIP by postmortem and histological examination exhibited FIP virus (FIPV) antigen in macrophages in granulomas whereas FIPV antigen was only once demonstrable in another location.',\n 'Serum haptoglobin as an indicator of the acute phase response in bovine respiratory disease. Abstract The early stages of the host response to infectious agents include a number of physiologic changes, collectively known as the acute phase response. The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml−1 in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.',\n 'Identification of γδT lymphocyte subsets that populate calf ileal mucosa after birth. Abstract Ileal intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes from newborn, 1.5-week-old, and 3-week-old calves were compared to determine to what extent the mucosa becomes populated after birth. Single and dual fluorescence flow cytometry were used with monoclonal antibodies to bovine (Bo) CD molecules to identify lymphocyte subpopulations. Few ileal mucosal lymphocytes were present in calves at birth. However, by 1.5 weeks of age, the villi were populated with large numbers of lymphocytes, and by 3 weeks of age, the numbers had increased further. These included a prominent subpopulation of γδT cells. Several subsets of γδT cells populated ileal mucosa after birth. The predominant subset coexpressed BoCD2, and a smaller subset coexpressed BoCD8. WC1+ γδT cells comprised the smallest subset. All γδT cell subsets coexpressed ACT2, a molecule expressed on activated WC1+ and WC1− γδT cells from cattle.',\n 'Bone-marrow derived macrophages as targets for the replication of mouse hepatitis virus type 3. Abstract Bone-marrow (BM) derived macrophages are sensitive target cells for replication of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). These cells can be grown in large numbers and the percentage of defined macrophages increased until day 10 when 100% of the cells represented macrophages. MHV3 replicated within these cells to high titers and caused the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells. This effect was seen with very low virus inocula in BM macrophages of C57BL/6 mice that are highly susceptible to in vivo infection with MHV3 whereas macrophages from resistant A/J mice did not show a cytopathic effect at these virus doses. 1000-fold higher virus doses, however, caused the cytopathic effect in macrophages of both C57BL/6 and A/J mice.',\n \"Genetic aspects of macrophage involvement in natural resistance to virus infections. Abstract Macrophages are thought to constitute an important element in the body's natural defense against invasion and dissemination of viruses. Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.\",\n 'Expression of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes from human renal cell carcinoma. Abstract We have previously demonstrated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) on synovial T cells from patients with different forms of arthritis. T cells of peripheral blood and serous body fluids are CD13-negative but can be stimulated to express CD13 after activation, e.g., with Con A. In the present report, double-labelling and flow cytometry analyses were performed to characterize the phenotype of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A large panel of antibodies specific for different activation-associated molecules on T cells was used. In contrast to TIL of lung cancer, TIL of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) consisted of significantly higher percentages of T cells expressing CD13, dipeptidylpeptidase N (DPIV, CD26) and HLA-DR, whereas T cells of lung cancer expressed more CD25, CD69 and CD54/ICAM1. No differences could be found in the expression of CD45RO, CD49a/VLA-1 and CD62L/L-selectin. Our results demonstrate that T cells in RCC and lung cancer differ in their phenotype, especially with respect to surface aminopeptidases. Investigations into the function of APN on T cells could be of help in gaining deeper insight into tumour defence as well as into general mechanisms of T cell functions.',\n 'Ontogeny of interferon alpha secreting cells in the porcine fetal hematopoietic organs. Abstract We examined the ontogeny of IFN-α Secreting Cells (IFN-α SC) in different hematopoietic organs and blood of porcine fetuses at different stages of gestation. Cells were induced to produce IFN-α by incubation with the coronavirus TGEV and IFN-α SC were detected by ELISPOT. A striking finding was that IFN-α SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at 26 days of gestation, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-α SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism. IFN-α SC were found to be associated with hematopoietic organs, which argues for their hematopoietic lineage.',\n 'Microglial cell response to neuronal degeneration in the brain of brindled mouse. Abstract Reactive changes of microglia in response to neuronal degeneration were investigated in the brains of brindled mottled mice with immunocytochemical technique. This mutant has a genetic defect in copper metabolism and spontaneous neuronal degeneration develops around postnatal day 10, in particular in the parasagittal regions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The antibodies to macrophage specific antigen, F4/80 and to type-three complement receptor, Mac-1 were used for the study. Reactive morphological changes of microglia, which are immuno-reactive to the antibodies to F4/80 and/or Mac-1, were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration, coincident with the emergence of cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, Ia, antigen. Some of the Ia expressing cells had morphological features of ramified microglia, while others were rod shaped with few processes and were mostly located in the perivascular regions. The focal nature of such cellular changes suggests that signal(s) from the degenerating neurons may be responsible for microglial activation and cellular expression of the Ia antigen in the brain of the brindled mouse.',\n 'The tumor phenotype and the human gene map. Abstract The tumor phenotype is associated with the rearrangement of genetic information and the altered expression of many gene products. In this review, genes associated with the tumor phenotype have been arranged on the human gene map and indicate the extent to which the tumor phenotype involves the human genome. Nonrandom chromosomal aberrations that are frequently observed in tumors are presented. Altered metabolic demands of the tumor cell are reflected in altered gene expressions of a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, and these changed enzyme patterns are described. The study of oncogenes increasingly suggests that they may be significant in certain cancers, and the assignment of these genes has been tabulated. The biochemical and metabolic changes observed in tumors are complex; studying the patterns and interactions of these changes will aid our genetic understanding of the origins and development of tumors.',\n 'Relapsing subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats during the course of coronavirus JHM infection. Abstract Temperature-sensitive mutants of the murine coronavirus JHM induced a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) in young rats. Neurological symptoms were associated with marked lesions of primary demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months. Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease. Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus. These results demonstrate that mutants of JHM virus can induce a relapsing demyelinating disease process, associated with a persistent infection, which possesses some similarities to chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.',\n 'Murine coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitides in rats: Analysis of immunoglobulins and virus-specific antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Abstract The humoral intrathecal immune response in coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats associated with an autoimmune reaction to brain antigen, was analysed. The CSF of these animals revealed immune reactions which were directed against coronavirus and other, unknown, antigens. In general, no direct correlation between the disease, the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), intrathecal synthesis of Ig and the presence of virus-specific antibodies was detectable, suggesting that the humoral, in contrast to the cellular, immune response does not play a significant pathogenetic role in this CNS disease.',\n 'Studies on the intrathecal humoral immune response in canine distemper encephalitis. Abstract Albumin and IgG were quantitated in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from dogs with demyelinating canine distemper virus (CDV) infection by means of rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The IgG index as indicator for intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was normal in animals with non-inflammatory demyelinating lesions and elevated in dogs with inflammatory myelin lesions. Specific antibodies against CDV and myelin were quantitated in CSF and serum from 8 dogs with an elevated IgG index. Eight of these dogs had significant amounts of antimyelin antibody and 4 dogs had neutralizing anti-CDV antibody in the CSF. Whereas the pathogenetic significance of antimyelin antibodies remains uncertain, the intrathecal antiviral immune response provides a plausible explanation for immunopathologic destruction of myelin in distemper.',\n 'Murine cortical brain cells are autoantigenic from a distinct development stage onwards. Abstract The expression of autoantigens on murine cortical brain cells and their first appearance during development was studied. Autoreactivity was analyzed by weight increase and lymphocyte proliferation in the popliteal lymph node (PLN). Cortical brain cells or defined plasma membrane preparations were injected s.c. without adjuvant into syngeneic recipients. Weak, but significant T cell-dependent PLN enlargement was triggered with brain cells from adult mice. A stronger reaction could be elicited with one defined fraction of purified plasma membranes. The earliest appearance of the antigenic material in the plasma membrane fraction was observed on day 15 after birth. This time point correlates exactly with the completion of the blood-brain barrier in large parts of the central nervous system.',\n 'Analysis of the intrathecal humoral immune response in Brown Norway (BN) rats, infected with the murine coronavirus JHM. Abstract Serum and CSF specimens from clinically healthy Brown Norway (BN) rats inoculated intracerebrally with corona virus JHM were analysed with respect to the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrathecal synthesis and isoelectric distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig). Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies. Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity. From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease.',\n 'Analysis of Ia induction on Lewis rat astrocytes in vitro by virus particles and bacterial adjuvants. Abstract Viral particles of a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus (JHM) and various substances known to have immunoregulatory effects, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and synthetic adjuvant peptide (muramyl dipeptide) (AP), were tested for their ability to induce Ia antigen expression on Lewis rat astrocytes in vitro. JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (γ-IFN). Whereas γ-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4–7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 have similar effects. These findings suggest that infectious agents may directly stimulate antigen presenting functions of astrocytes in the brain through γ-IFN-independent mechanisms.',\n 'Induction of class I and class II transplantation antigens in rat brain during fatal and non-fatal measles virus infection. Abstract Measles virus induced a marked increase in the expression of MHC-coded class I and class II antigens as detected by immunostaining during both fatal and non-fatal brain infections in rats. The distribution of these molecules in the brain was much more widespread than the occurence of viral antigen suggesting a soluble factor for their induction. In 14-day-old rats with a non-fatal infection there was a marked infiltration of T lymphocytes of ‘cytotoxic/suppressor’ phenotype in the brain parenchyma, whereas T ‘helper’ cell phenotypes mainly were located perivascularly. In brains from newborn rats with a fatal infection no or only few lymphocytes were detected.',\n \"Chronic Theiler's virus infection in mice: appearance of myelin basic protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum antibody directed against MBP. Abstract Myelin basic protein (MBP) appears frequently in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with chronic demyelination following intracerebral infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV); antibody to MBP can frequently be found in the sera. The peaks of the immune responses to both MBP and TMEV coincide with the time course of the clinical signs of disease. Adsorption of mouse sera with TMEV or MBP indicate the non-identity of the antigens and the specificity of the antisera as measured by ELISA. Immunoblot analysis of sera confirmed the ELISA findings. The mechanism of induction of antibody directed against MBP and its role in TMEV-associated demyelination remain to be determined.\",\n 'MHC antigen expression on bulk isolated macrophage-microglia from newborn mouse brain: induction of Ia antigen expression by γ-interferon. Abstract Macrophage-microglia were isolated from primary mixed brain cell cultures of normal newborn mice. They were successfully maintained in vitro for at least 8 weeks. Purity of the cultures was 97–100%, as determined by endocytosis of latex beads, non-specific staining through Fc receptors, EA and EAC rosette formation. These cells were non-specific esterase-positive, but peroxidase-negative. Electron-microscope observations revealed morphological similarities to mature macrophages. Isolated macrophage-microglia seldom incorporated [3H]thymidine in vitro. By means of 51Cr release assay, using monoclonal antibodies against mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and complement, we detected class I MHC (H-2) antigen on unstimulated macrophage-microglia, and both class I and class II (Ia) antigens on γ-interferon-treated cells. These observations suggest possible immunoregulatory functions of macrophage-microglia in the central nervous system, as is characteristics of other cells of monocyte lineage.',\n 'Delayed-type hypersensitivity response in the central nervous system during JHM virus infection requires viral specificity for protection. Abstract The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) elicits an I-A-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response mediated by a Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, and CD4+ T cell. Adoptive transfer of these polyclonal CD4+ T cells from immunized mice prevents death in lethally infected recipients without significantly reducing virus titer in the central nervous system (CNS). These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge. Neither type of DTH reaction suppressed virus replication or prevented death from concomitant lethal JHMV infection.',\n 'Comparative analysis of virus-specific antibodies and immunoglobulins in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of subacute measles virus-induced encephalomyelitis (SAME) in rats and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Abstract The intrathecal humoral immune response was analysed in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and Lewis rats with subacute measles virus (MV)-induced encephalomyelitis (SAME). SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunoglobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.',\n 'Induction of autoimmune reactions to myelin basic protein in measles virus encephalitis in Lewis rats. Abstract Intracerebral inoculation of weanling Lewis rats with measles virus led to the development of subacute measles encephalomyelitis (SAME) 4–8 weeks after infection. The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination. Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME. These results indicate that autoimmune reactions to brain antigen can arise during measles virus infection which may contribute to the pathogenesis of measles virus-associated encephalomyelitis.',\n 'Cytotoxic effect of myelin basic protein-reactive T cells on cultured oligodendrocytes. Abstract To help clarify effector mechanisms in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the cytotoxic effects of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes on oligodendrocytes were studied using a 51Cr release assay. MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to 51Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP ( percent 51 Cr release = 65±3% vs. spontaneous release = 22±3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 ± 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.',\n 'Differential expression and regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products in neural and glial cells of the human fetal brain. Abstract The cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have the peculiarity of physiologically expressing very low levels of HLA molecules. In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-α and -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-γ or TNF-α oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-γ. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.',\n 'Tumor necrosis factor induces expression of MHC class I antigens on mouse astrocytes. Abstract The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was examined in mouse glial cells in vitro. TNF induced MHC class I, but not class II, antigen expression on the surface of astrocytes but not on oligodendrocytes. Glial cells do not normally express detectable amounts of MHC antigens. Thus TNF may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of neurologic diseases that involve MHC class I-restricted reactions.',\n 'Differential modulation of MHC class I antigen expression on mouse brain endothelial cells by MHV-4 infection. Abstract Virus-induced modulation of mouse cerebral endothelial cell class I and class II antigens by the neurotropic coronavirus, MHV-4 (JHM), was examined by flow cytometry. In susceptible BALB/c, H-2Kd was downregulated, while H-2Dd was upregulated following infection by MHV-4. In contrast, H-2K and H-2D antigens were both upregulated in either MHV-4-susceptible B10.S and (BALB/c × SJL) F1, or MHV-4-resistant SJL-derived cerebral endothelial cells following infection with this virus. Class II antigen expression was unchanged following MHV-4 infection. Virus-induced MHC class I modulation is genetically regulated, and may influence virus clearance by class I-dependent CTL.',\n 'Induciton of MHC class I antigens on glial cells is dependent on persistent mouse hepatitis virus infection. Abstract H-2 class I antigens, but not class II antigens, were detected on the surface of glial cells persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) as late as 90 days post-infection. Uninfected glial cells remained negative for H-2 class I and class II surface antigens. We have previously shown that conditioned media from infected glial cell cultures (supernatants) contain a factor unrelated to infectious virus and capable of inducing H-2 class I antigens on uninfected glial cells. The synthesis of this factor appears to be dependent on production of infectious virus since the H-2 inducing activity could not be detected 3 days following the addition of neutralizing antibodies to the cultures. This suggests that H-2 inducing activity contains as unstable component, the synthesis of which is dependent on continual virus production. Persistent MHV infection and H-2 class I antigen expression may play a role in MHV-induced demyelination.',\n 'Infiltration of immune T cells in the brain of mice with herpes simplex virus-induced encephalitis. Abstract Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of mice can induce viral encephalitis. Using two-fluorochrome immunofluorescence, our present study shows that though there is extensive myelin loss and necrosis in the brain stem of mice with HSV encephalitis, only some oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells are infected. T cells that express CD4 or CD8 and a large number of CD4+, F4/80+ macrophages are present in perivascular infiltrates close to and in contact with HSV-infected cells in areas of massive myelin loss. These findings suggest that the resultant infiltration of immune cells into the brain during HSV-1 infection may cause as much damage as the virus itself.',\n 'Virus-specific and autoreactive T cell lines isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with chronic rubella panencephalitis. Abstract Using a recently described technique for expanding of human T lymphocyte populations from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we investigated the local cellular immune response in a patient with chronic rubella panencephalitis. A total of 328 T cell lines (TCLs) was established by seeding CSF cells at limitin dilution into histoplates in the presence of irradiated feeder cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-containing conditioned medium. 80% of TCLs expressed the CD4+ CD8−, 5% the CD4− CD8+ phenotype and 15% of TCLs contained different proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Of 191 TCLs analyzed, 85 were cytotoxic, as shown by their lectin-dependent cytotoxicity against allogeneic uninfected target cells. Eight of them demonstrated specificity for the autologous, rubella virus-infected target cells. When testes for antigen-specific proliferative activity, 26 TCLs responded to rubella antigen, 16 TCLs reacted to myelin basic protein (MBP), four TCLs to proteolipid protein (PLP), four to galactocerebrosides and two to actin. Fourteen out of 16 MBP-specific TCLs also responded, to a minor degree, to rubella antigen and/or actin. The results showed that the persisting rubella infection had given rise to autoreactive T cells. Virus-induced autoreactivity to brain antigens may be an important pathogenic mechanism in other chronic inflammatory disorders of the CNS.',\n 'Lymphocyte-myelin sheath interactions in acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Abstract Using a passively transferred acute model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the rat, inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) lesions were shown to develop rapidly, peak and then resolve. An unusual feature of the lesions in the CNS was the presence of pyknotic cells within myelin sheaths. A sequence of observations indicated that such cells were lymphocytes which had insinuated themselves into the myelin sheath by passage along the interperiod line. The presence of lymphocytes within myelin sheaths, a process which did not lead to demyelination, was considered to represent a change which reflects the specificity of the immune response in this disease. The detection of this change in other CNS autoimmune diseases, notably those associated with virus infections, may be important as an indicator of pathogenetically relevant lymphocyte-myelin interactions.',\n 'β-Endorphin alters a viral induced central nervous system disease in normal mice but not in nude mice. Abstract A single intracerebroventricular injection of 100 ng of β-endorphin altered the course of the central nervous system (CNS) infection of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), tsG31-KS5. When mice were administered β-endorphin and then 24 h later infected intracerebrally with tsG31-Ks5 VSV, 70% of the animals died within 8 days of infection. In comparison, less than 10% of the animals had died after 21 days when infected with tsG31-KS5 VSV alone. When mice were injected with β-endorphin and tsG31-KS5 VSV simultaneously, or with β-endorphin 21 days after infection, the more aggressive clinical disease was not observed. Superficially, the more lethal disease induced by β-endorphin appeared to be a result of a mild hypothermia caused by the neuropeptide. β-Endorphin, however, did not influence the disease in nude (nu/nu) mice even though their core temperatures were reduced to an extent similar to that of BALB/c (+/+) mice, implicating the involvement of T lymphocytes in the alteration of the course of infection in normal mice.',\n 'Early major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen induction in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in trypanosome-infected rats. Abstract Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of Trypanosoma brucei. An early induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens as well as an infiltration of macrophage-like and cytotoxic T-cells was detected with immunohistochemical techniques in circumventricular organs, such as the median eminence, neurohypophosis, subformical organ, pineal gland and area postrema. These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the medain eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blod or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells. It is suggested that the alteration in the nerve cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei is caused by retrograde axonal signals from these target areas. Sleeping sickness; Trypanosomes; Paraventricular nucleus; Major histocompatibility complex classI',\n 'Genetic regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen induction on astrocytes. Abstract Neural cells, indluding astrocytes, normally do not express detectable levels of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, unlike cells of most tissues. However, upon cultivation in vitro, astrocytes begin to express class I molecules, increasing with time after plating. This spontaneous expression was examined in the present study to characterize inducible expression on astrocytes among various strains of mice. Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard γ-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2a and H-2d class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2b and H-2s products. This difference in expression is not seen on spleen cells indicating tissue specificity. Moreover, levels of expression at the cell surface are reflected by the steady-state level of RNA message within astrocytes of the different strains.',\n 'Tumor necrosis factor-α enhances interferon-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. Abstract Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II antigens, which are induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can act synergistically with IFN-γ with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-α on IFN-γ-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-α alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-γ for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-α activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-α with a polyclonal anti-TNF-α antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-α enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-γ 12–24 h prior to TNF-α addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-γ and TNF-α may be increased TNF-α receptor expression by IFN-γ. Astrocytes treated with IFN-γ for 24 h express more TNF-α receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K d). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-α requires an inductive signal from IFN-γ, which in part may be increased TNF-α receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-α enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-γ. TNF-α exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-α receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-γ. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.',\n 'Effect of cyclosporin A on an experimental chronic viral infection of the central nervous system. Abstract The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on neuropathological lesions induced by a chronic viral infection have been tested in the experimental model of the mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis. The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time. Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment. During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice. In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality.',\n 'Immunohistochemical studies of adult human glial cells. Abstract Using immunohistochemical techniques, we examined major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages-microglia derived from surgically resected tissue from young adults and maintained in dissociated cell cultures supplemented with either fetal calf or human AB serum. The majority of these cells in culture expressed class I MHC antigens. MHC class II expression was observed on only a restricted proportion of astrocytes either under basal or induction conditions (γ-interferon, activated lymphocyte supernatants), on the majority of macrophages-microglia under inducing conditions, and not on oligodendrocytes. MHC class II expression on astrocytes in culture did not correlate with the extent of in situ gliosis or with in vitro cell morphology. MHC antigen expression was not detected in situ immunohistochemically. These data extend observations on the dissociation of in vivo and in vitro expression of MHC antigens on glial cells. The apparent greater expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages-microglia compared to astrocytes raises the issue of the relative roles of each of these cell types in promoting immune reactivity under pathologic conditions.',\n 'Peripheral nerve lesion produces increased levels of major histocompatibility complex antigens in the central nervous system. Abstract Proliferation of central nervous system (CNS) glia in response to peripheral nerve injury occurs without apparent participation of cells of the immune system. It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucleus. It is demonstrated by double-immunofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased levels of MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that microglia are immunocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immubological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.',\n 'Flavivirus infection up-regulates the expression of class I and class II major histocompatibility antigens on and enhances T cell recognition of astrocytes in vitro. Abstract West Nile virus (WNV) infection of astrocytes can up-regulate their expression of both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens as determined by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specific for class I and class II MHC antigens. The up-regulation of class I MHC antigen expression could be partly caused by interferon secreted after WNV infection because the synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I : C) has similar effects. In contrast the up-regulation of class II MHC antigen expression was not induced by poly I : C. The increased MHC antigen expression by WNV infection had significant effects on T cell recognition. Thus, WNV and influenza virus A/WSN double-infected astrocytes but not astrocytes infected by A/WSN alone were lysed by influenza virus-immune cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, WNV-infected astrocytes were better stimulators than normal astrocytes for a class II MHC-reactive T cell line, both in terms of T cell proliferation and interleukin release.',\n 'Demyelination induced by murine hepatitis virus JHM strain (MHV-4) is immunologically mediated. Abstract The neurotropic mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), in particular strain JHM (JHMV or MHV-4), cause experimental central nervous system demyelination that pathologically resembles multiple sclerosis, an important human demyelinating disease. The mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination remains unclear, though its tropism for oligodendrocytes had led to the belief that JHMV causes demyelination by direct lysis of these myelin-producing cells. However, several studies have also implicated the involvement of immune responses in the demyelinating process. In this communication, we present evidence that generalized immunosuppression with gamma irradiation prevents JHMV-induced demyelination, a finding that was not limited to a particular strain of JHMV or to one strain of mouse. In addition, significant paralytic-demyelinating disease was restored to infected, irradiated mice after the adoptive transfer of nylon wool nonadherent splenic cells and appeared to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These observations indicate that the principal mechanisms of JHMV-induced demyelination are most likely immunopathological.',\n 'Human oligodendrocytes are susceptible to cytolysis by major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted lymphocytes. Abstract The majority of human oligodendrocytes in enriched glial cell cultures expresses class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. We used a 51Cr release assay to study the susceptibility of oligodendrocyte-enriched glial cells to MHC-restricted and non-restricted immune-mediated cytolysis. Mitogen-activated mononuclear cells induced significant lysis in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Mononuclear cells allo-activated in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture with E− cells from the glial cell donor induced a significantly higher degree of oligodendrocyte cytolysis than mononuclear cells activated with E− cells bearing MHC-class I antigens discordant with the glia. Cytolysis by alloactivated unfractionated lymphocytes and by purified CD8+ lymphocytes was reduced by an anti-class I antibody (W6/32). Our findings suggest that human oligodendrocytes can be susceptible targets for MHC class I-restricted lysis.',\n 'The effects of irradiation on major histocampatibility complex expression and lymphocytic infiltration in the normal rat brain and the 9L gliosarcoma brain tumor model. Abstract The effects of irradiation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression and lymphocytic infiltration in the normal rat brain and the 9L gliosarcoma brain tumor model were examined. Doses of irradiation administered were biologically equivalent to that used in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. No significant change in immune parameters was observed following irradiation in the normal rat brain. In the 9L gliosarcoma model irradiation did not suppress MHC expression or lymphocytic infiltration. These findings suggest that prior exposure to therapeutic irradiation need not adversely affect subsequent immunotherapies, and provide a foundation for future studies of immunomodulation in the irradiated brain.',\n 'Induction and regulation of class II major histocompatibility complex mRNA expression in astrocytes by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Abstract Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which are induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) enhances IFN-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-γ-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-γ. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-γ and TNF-α to the astrocytes, while TNF-α alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-α does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-γ-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ/TNF-α. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.',\n \"Class II-restricted T cell responses in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease III. Failure of neuroantigen-specific immune tolerance to affect the clinical course of demyelination. Abstract Intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) into susceptible mouse strains produces a chronic demyelinating disease in which mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS) are prominent. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91–104) and PLP(139–151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. The relationship of the present results to the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis is discussed.\",\n 'Characteristics of in vitro cytotoxic effects of myelin basic protein-reactive T cell lines on syngeneic oligodendrocytes. Abstract We have previously found that Lewis rat myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes (Lc) were cytotoxic in vitro to cultured syngeneic oligodendrocytes (oligos). We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by 51Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked 51Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) 51Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of 51Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 ± 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc + APC (12 ± 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 ± 2.8%). Surface expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was expressed on the surface of the target oligos during this in vitro cytotoxic reaction. This may explain our previously observed MHC restriction in this reaction. The findings described here may explain some of the in vivo pathogenic events in EAE.',\n 'Characterization of measles virus-induced cellular autoimmune reactions against myelin basic protein in Lewis rats. Abstract Subacute encephalomyelitis (SAME) in Lewis rats following infection with a neurotropic measles virus (MV) is associated with a cell-mediated autoimmune response (CMAI) to myelin badic protein (MBP). MBP-selected CD44+ T cell lines both from measles-infected animals as well as from rats challenged with guinea pig MBP (Gp-MBP) had a similar pattern of response in the presence of synthetic peptides to Gp-MBP and specifically responded in vitro only to the encephalitogenic and not the non-encephalitogenic or other control peptides. In primary splenic lymphocyte cultures from SAME animals, however, a low but significant T-cell response was obtained against the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 (residues 69–81) of the Gp-MBP. Moreover, immunization of MV-infected rats with this peptide induced clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 38% of the animals. The results of the study show that the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 can be rendered encephalitogenic in rats when an additional stimulus is given in the form of MV infection. The data indicate further that MV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) enhances the susceptibility of the CNS to autoimmune T cell aggression.',\n 'Adult human glial cells can present target antigens to HLA-restricted cytotoxic T-cells. Abstract T-lymphocyte recognition of antigen either on antigen-presenting cells (APC) necessary for the generation of an immune response or on target cells during the effector phase of a cellular immune response requires expression of HLA molecules. Although immune mechanisms operate in many disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS), cells of the CNS generally express low levels of HLA molecules. In this study, the potential for upregulation of HLA molecules on adult human glial cells was examined. Moreover, the functional implication of this upregulation was assessed by the capacity of glial cells to process and present target antigens to HLA class I-restricted influenza-specific and class II-restrict myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CTL lines. Glial cells cultured from adult human surgical brain specimens or cells from established glioblastoma multiforme cell lines were studied. Lysis by antigen-specific CTLs was dependent on treatment of the target cell with interferon-γ. The lysis was HLA restricted and antigen specific. The results indicate that adult human glial cells can process and present antigen to HLA-restricted CTLs but require the upregulation of HLA molecules. These findings have implications for infectious and autoimmune diseases of the CNS.',\n 'Differential suppression of interferon-γ-induced Ia antigen expression on cultured rat astroglia and microglia by second messengers. Abstract The roles of intracellular second messengers in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced Ia antigen (Ag) expression by astroglia and microglia were examined. Ia Ag on both glia types was induced by IFN-γ. Reagents known to increase intracellular cAMP or activate intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) reduced IFN-γ-induced Ia Ag expression by astroglia. In contrast, increasing intracellular cAMP had no suppressive effect on Ia Ag expression by microglia. These results indicate (1) cAMP and PKC negatively regulate IFN-γ-induced Ia expression on astroglia, and (2) Ia expression is regulated differentially in astroglia vs. microglia. These findings may explain the frequent observation of Ia+ microglia (or macrophages) but not astroglia in various neurodegenerative diseases.',\n 'Interleukin-1β decreases HLA class II expression on a glioblastoma multiforme cell line. Abstract Antigens encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are not normally expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but can be induced by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Other cytokines released during an inflammatory process can potentially influence MHC expression as well. One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregulatory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effedt of IL-1β on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-1β/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-γ. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-1β. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP α and β) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-1β treatment. A minimal concentration of 1 U IL-1β/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-1β for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.',\n 'Production of mice from a lethal coronavirus infection in the central nervous system by adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell clones. Abstract The protective effect of a mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4)-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell clone and a CD4+ helper T cell clone was examined by the adoptive transfer into brains of mice lethally infected with MHV-4. Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 × 105 cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transfered into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and the CD4+ helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system.',\n 'Gamma interferon expression and major histocompatibility complex induction during measles and vesicular stomatitis virus infections of the brain. Abstract Lymphocytic interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen induction were studied in experimental measles and vesicular stomatitis virus infections in the brain. Fifteen-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats injected intracerebrally with the HNT strain of measles virus showed already within 1 day after infection an increased number of cells producing IFN-γ in the spleen, cervical lymph nodes and leptomeninges. These rats recovered after a transient neuronal infection in the brain. Rats infected intracerebrally with vesicular stomatitis virus, on the other hand, all succumbed after 2 days and showed no IFN-γ production in lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemically MHC class I antigen appeared in infected and uninfected cells in the brain during replication of both viruses. A role for the recently discovered nerve fibres with IFN-γ-like immunoreactivity, which are normally present in the brain, in the MHC antigen induction is discussed.',\n 'Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4, JHM) blocks γ-interferon-induced major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression on murine cerebral endothelial cells. Abstract The regulation of γ-interferon-induced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen expression on mouse cerebral endothelial cells by the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4, JHM) was studied in vitro. The results presented demonstrate that MHV-4 can selectively block γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression on cerebral endothelial cells. The blocking effect of class II expression occurs in a strain-dependent manner, and is limited to virus-susceptible mouse strains. Virus replication is not required to obtain the blocking effect since UV-inactivated MHV-4 produces the same result. MHV-4 blocking of γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression is observed at both the cell surface (flow cytometry) and transcriptional level (Norhtern analysis).',\n 'Demonstration of the presence of a specific interferon-γ receptor on murine astrocyte cell surface. Abstract Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a pleiotropic lymphokine produced by T-lymphocytes which acts as a soluble mediator in immunological reactions. In addition to several immune target cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, it acts on the principal glial population, the astrocytes, inducing Ia antigen expression. We have developed a binding assay for 125I-labeled recombinant murine IFN-γ, and show that, using this assay, IFN-γ interacts with a single specific receptor on the murine astrocyte cell membrane. The binding is specific and saturable and it takes place with a K d = 1.64 × 10−9 M, with 11,100 receptor molecules per astrocytic cell. The binding shows, as for macrophages, species specificity. Using an immune assay including rabbit antibodies to IFN-γ and 125I-labeled protein A, we have demonstrated an internalization of the ligand. This is an energy-dependent process, as around 50% of the bound IFN-γ is endocytosed after 4 h at 37°C when cultures are maintained in complete culture medium.',\n 'Multiple sclerosis patients have reduced HLA class II-restricted cytotoxic responses specific for both measles and herpes virus. Abstract It has been previously demonstrated that the generation of measles virus (MV)-specific cytotoxicity (CTL) is reduced in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.',\n 'Characterization of brain-infiltrating mononuclear cells during infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM. Abstract The eradication of infectious virus from the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) is thought to be immune-mediated. Furthermore, a significant decrease of infectious virus coincides with the appearance of prominent inflammatory infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord. In the present study, mononuclear cells infiltrating the brain during JHMV infection were isolated and characterized. While all subsets of immune cells were present, there appeared to be a temporal relationship between the peak incidence of CD8+ T cells (40% of total isolated cells) and reduction of virus at day 7 post-infection. Cells with the natural killer (NK) phenotype (at least 30%) were also present throughout infection. These data suggest that CD8+ T cells and NK cells are prominent among cells which infiltrate the brain during JHM virus infection and may have important roles in reduction of virus within the CNS.',\n 'The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens in the brain differs markedly in acute and persistent infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Abstract Intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a fatal neurologic illness. In this disease a marked increase in MHC class I expression was found, closely associated with viral antigens and inflammatory infiltrates, in meninges, choroid plexus and ventricular ependyma but not within the brain parenchyma. Immunosuppression prevented MHC induction. Mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections, with LCMV antigens found primarily in neurons, but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in MHC class I. Failure of infected neurons to express MHC class I allow them to escape destruction by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non-lytic viruses.',\n 'Expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes in astrocytes correlates with the presence of nuclear factors that bind to constitutive and inducible enahcers. Abstract The molecular basis of constitutive and inducible major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression was studied in murine astrocytes in primary culture. Astrocytes constitutively expressed MHC class I molecules and treatment of these cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) further induced expression. The conserved region containing the upstream MHC class I regulatory element (MHC-CRE) and juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence (ICS) enhanced consttutive MHC class I promoter activity. As seen with cell surface expression of MHC molecules, treatment of astrocytes with IFN-γ increased MHC class I promoter activity. Inducible expression required the presence of the MHC-CRE/ICS enhancer region. Nuclear factors that bind to the MHC-CRE and ICS were constitutively expressed in cultured astrocytes and IFN-γ treatment further induced binding activity both to the MHC-CRE and ICS and correlated with induction of MHC class I gene expression. This study identifies the MHC-CRE and ICS as the major cis elements in controlling MHC class I promoter activity and suggests that the expression of nuclear factor binding activities to these enhancer elements is a basic transactivating mechanism for the expression of MHC class I genes in astrocytes.',\n 'T-lymphocyte recognition of a portion of myelin basic protein encoded by an exon expressed during myelination. Abstract The major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult central nervous system is the 18.5-kDa protein which is produced by mRNA derived from exons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the MBP gene. Since isoforms containing exon 2-encoded protein (X2MBP) are expressed during myelin formation, we examined T cell ractivity specific for X2MBP in a disease characterized by remyelination subsequent to demyelination, multiple sclerosis (MS). T cell lines specific for X2MBP were derived from three MS patients as well as one healthy control. This suggests that candidate autoantigens in demyelinating/remyelinating diseases should include not only the major isoforms of myelin proteins, but also isoforms expressed aberrantly during a disease process since they too may be the target of a T cell-mediated autoimmune process.',\n 'Virus specificity and isotype expression of intraparenchymal antibody-secreting cells during Sindbis virus encephalitis in mice. Abstract To study the generation of specific antibody responses within the central nervous system (CNS), we have utilized a murine model of acute viral encephalitis. When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5–7 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadi throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.',\n 'β-Endorphin protects mice from neurological disease induced by the murine coronavirus MHV-JHM. Abstract The neurotropic murine coronavirus, MHV-JHM (JHMV) causes encephalitis and paralytic-demyelinating disease in susceptible strains of mice and rats, serving as a model for human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In this communication, we report that a single intracerebral administration of the naturally occurring neuropeptide, β-endorphin, reduced the incidence of JHMV-induced paralytic-demyelinating disease 40–50% in C57Bl/6 mice. Protection from disease was accompanied by significantly reduced virus replication in the brain as early as 3 days post-infection and did not occur in irradiated, or immunoincompetent mice. The data suggest that β-endorphin engages immune mechanisms of host resistance to JHMV infection to protect the mice from disease.',\n \"Endogenous gamma interferon produced in central nervous system by systemic infection infection with Theiler's virus in mice. Abstract Theiler's virus GD VII strain causes acute encephalomyelitis by intracerebral inoculation. We established acute encephalomyelitis in mice by the intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of Theiler's virus GD VII strain. Replication of Theiler's virus injected i.v. could be observed in both the brain and spinal cord of mice, and interferon (IFN)-γ could be detected in the extracts of brain and spinal cord in parallel with viral replication. Furthermore, by the injection of anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (mAb) on Day 1 post-infection (p.i.), mortality and virus titres in the spinal cord increased compared with the control mice treated with normal rat globulin. The histological exacerbation of inflammation was observed in spinal cord of anti-IFN-γ mAb-treated mice. These results indicate that endogenous IFN-γ, produced locally in the brain and spinal cord of mice through both antiviral action and anti-inflammatory action of IFN-γ in central nervous system, plays an important role in Theiler's virus infection.\",\n 'Interleukin-6 induction in vitro in mouse brain endothelial cells and astrocytes by exposure to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4, JHM). Abstract Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction, as detected by bioassay and Northern analysis, was examined in vitro in endothelial cells or astrocytes derived from BALB/c (susceptible) or SJL (resistant) mice following exposure to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4) or UV inactivated MHV-4 (UV-MHV-4). In BALB/c endothelial cells, up to 16-fold more IL-6 (> 640 U/ml) was induced, compared to SJL cells which showed a minimal response (40 U/ml), relative to basal levels (< 20 U/ml). In contrast, both BALB/c and SJL astrocytes showed a substantial IL-6 response to MHV-4 and UV-MHV-4 exposure, although a strain difference persisted. Despite strain and cell specific differences in released IL-6, equivalent levels of IL-6 mRNA were induced in all cell types following exposure to MHV-4 or UV-MHV-4.',\n 'Trafficking of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes into the central nervous system: Use of a transgenic model. Abstract We have used cell or tissue-specific promoters to express lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) proteins in selected cells in independent lines of transgenic mice. Upon adoptive transfers into these mice, MHC-restricted LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes homed specifically to either the choroid plexus (SV40 promoter) or β cells of the islets of Langerhans (rat insulin promoter). The availability of promoters specific for neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes makes this approach compelling for evaluating T cell trafficking into the CNS and for analyzing antigen presentation in vivo in the CNS.',\n 'A novel candidate autoantigen in a multiplex family with multiple sclerosis: prevalence of T-lymphocytes specific for an MBP epitope unique to myelination. Abstract Although the major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult CNS is the 18.5-kDa protein, other isoforms containing exon 2 encoded protein (21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa) exist and are expressed primarily during myelin formation. Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP. In addition, while frequencies of TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were no different between the affected and unaffected, the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs correlated with disease.',\n 'Synergistic interaction between measles virus infection and myelin basic protein peptide-specific T cells in the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats. Abstract The questions how a viral infection induces cellular autoimmune reactions (CMAI) and which components of both virus and auto-antigen play part in this process were addressed in our animal model of measles virus (MV)-induced CMAI against myelin basic protein (MBP) during subacute measles encephalitis (SAME). In an attempt to define whether cellular or humoral immune responses are involved in the occurrence of the autoimmune based disease process, Lewis rats were treated with different combinations of antibodies and T cells reactive with either MV and its structural proteins or MBP and MBP-peptides. The only treatment combination after which experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease and pathology developed was when non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive against residues 69–81 of MBP were adoptively transferred into MV-infected Lewis rats. The results of the study show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a viral infection involving the brain.',\n 'Interleukin-4 induces proliferation and activation of microglia but suppresses their induction of class II major histocompatibility complex antigen expression. Abstract We recently found that microglia, brain macrophages, express interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor mRNA in vitro. Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [3H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN γ-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.',\n 'Cervical lymphoid tissue but not the central nervous system supports proliferation of virus-specific T lymphocytes during coronavirus-induced encephalitis in rats. Abstract The CD4+ T lymphocyte response in the central nervous system (CNS) and cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) of rats with different susceptibility to coronavirus-induced encephalitis was investigated. The majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.',\n 'Encephalitogenicity of myelin basic protein exon-2 peptide in mice. Abstract Immunization with a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to mouse myelin basic protein exon-2 induced mild experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in B10.RIII mice, very mild disease in SJL/J mice and no disease in (SJL × PL)F1 hybrid mice. In contrast, adoptive transfer of an exon-2 peptide-specific T cell line from SJL mice induced severe relapsing EAE in syngeneic recipients. The T cell line was specific for exon-2 peptide and did not cross-react appreciably with an MBP preparation consisting of the 18.5 and 14-kDa isoforms. mRNA for exon-2 containing isoforms could be demonstrated in the spinal cord of SJL/J and B10.RIII mice by amplification using exon-2 and exon-4 oligonucleotide primers. On a relative basis, the level of exon-2 cDNA was lower than that of exon-1 cDNA in the same spinal cord preparations from both strains of mice.',\n 'Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced by the peptide encoded by exon 2 of the MBP gene, a peptide implicated in remyelination. Abstract The discovery of T lymphocytes reactive to the peptide encoded by exon 2 of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has drawn attention to MBP isoforms harboring that peptide as candidate autoantigens. Previously, immunological studies in MS had almost exclusively used the more abundant 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP, which does not does not contain the exon 2 peptide. Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have also focussed on the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform and its peptides. Since EAE is an animal model widely used widly used to study MS, we examined the encephalitogenic potential of exon 2 peptide in the SJL/J mouse. Evidence for increased expression of exon 2-containing isoforms during remyelination in mouse CNS suggested that exon 2-sensitized T cels, with encephalitogenic capacity, might be important in the pertuation of relapsing EAE (rEAE). Our experiments have demonstrated that exon 2 peptide is inherently immunogenic in SJL mice and that EAE could be induced by the adoptive transfer of exon 2-sensitized lymphocytes. Furthermore, the disease could be accentuated by the transfer of short-term exon 2-reactive lines or by a combination of adoptive transfer and antigenic challenge with exon 2 peptide. The immunodominant epitope(s) appeared to localize to the segment bordered by amino acids 59–85.',\n 'Alteration of intracerebral cytokine production in mice infected with herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Abstract Previously we reported that a lethal strain of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infects the brain following ocular inoculation of mice. We now demonstrate that HSV-2 mediates an unusual intracellular sequestering of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-γ and IL-6 gene transcription in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4+ lymphocytes. These data suggest that the infecting herpesvirus can influence the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines, which in turn may determine the outcome of the infection.',\n 'Facilitation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by irradiation and virus infection: role of inflammatory cells. Abstract Infection with an avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) facilitates the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a genetically resistant BALB/c mouse strain. Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4+ and CD8+ cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1+ cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1+ cells and a few CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.',\n 'A transgenic mouse model to assess the interaction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with virally infected, class I MHC-expressing astrocytes. Abstract Astrocytes provide crucial support for neurons and their impairment by viruses or their interactions with anti-viral or autoimmune responses could contribute to neurological disease. We have developed a transgenic mouse model to assess lymphocyte-astrocyte interactions. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, Db, was expressed in astrocytes under the transcriptional control of regulatory sequences from the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Baseline cerebral MHC class I mRNA levels from transgenic mice were elevated over those of non-transgenic controls, and a prominent increase in cerebral MHC class I expression occurred following focal, injury-induced astroglial activation within transgenic brains but not in non-transgenic controls. FACS analysis of explant astrocyte cultures from established transgenic lines demonstrated astroglial expression of the GFAP-Db fusion gene at the protein level. Functional antigen-presenting capacity was conferred by the Db transgene, as virus-infected primary astrocytes obtained from transgenic BALB/c mice (KdIdDdLd) expressing the Db molecule were lysed by Db-restricted anti-viral CTL.',\n \"Theiler's virus is eliminated by a gamma-interferon-independent mechanism in the brain. Abstract The intravenous infection of Theiler's virus GD VII strain causes acute encephalomyelitis in infected mice. To determine the cellular mechanism of resistance and interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cell populations, mononuclear cells isolated from tissues of the brain were analyzed by the flow cytometry method. Antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ, and Asialo GM1 were used to deplete the corresponding cell populations in Theiler's virus-infected mice. CD4+ lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes infiltrated in the brains of infected mice from 5 days postinfection (p.i.). The number of CD3+/TCR-γδ+ lymphocytes increased in the brains on Day 6 p.i. The elimination of CD3+ lymphocytes or CD4+ lymphocytes augmented viral replication and suppressed the production of IFN-γ. The suppression of IFN-γ production by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) persisted, although the suppression by anti-CD4 mAb was observed only on Day 6 p.i. The depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes as well as TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes also augmented the viral replication; however, it did not alter the production of IFN-γ. Anti-Asialo GM1 antibody had no effect on viral replication and IFN-γ production. These results indicate that T lymphocytes are important for eliminating Theiler's virus from the brain, CD3+/CD4+/CD8− lymphocytes and CD3+/TCRαβ−/CD4−/CD8− lymphocytes would produce IFN-γ in brain. However, from the result on the experiment of the depletion of TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes, the defence mechanisms by T lymphocytes against Theiler's virus would be independent of endogenous IFN-γ production.\",\n 'Modulation of immune-associated surface markers and cytokine production by murine retinal glial cells. Abstract Murine retinal glia are normally negative for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II antigens and express low levels of MHC Class I and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as detected by avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry. These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant Interferonγ (rIFN-γ). MHC Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rlFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-1 expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-γ. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CMS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-1 expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-α (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml) for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-γ or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supernatants. Levels of secreted TNF-α increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface- or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.',\n 'Interferon production by leukocytes in children with otitis media with effusion. Abstract We have previously shown that leukocyte cultures of children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections produce less interferon (IFN) than those of healthy children. In the present study this tentative marker of recurrent infections was used to study the pathogenetic background of otitis media with effusion (OME). Altogether 57 consecutive children, aged 2–11 years, who came for tympanostomy and/or adenoidectomy were divided into three subgroups: 25 of them had OME and a history of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM/OME +), 20 had OME without an infectious background (inf- /OME +), and 12 had a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (inf +/OME —) without OME. All the children were free of acute illness at the time of sampling. Differences between the groups were seen in IFN yields when leukocyte cultures were stimulated with adeno-, rhino-, corona-, respiratory syncytial or influenza A viruses. Leukocytes from inf- /OME + children produced more IFN than those of the other two groups. Though no sex differences in the IFN responses were seen among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children, leukocytes from inf- /OME + girls produced significantly higher amounts of IFN than those of inf- /OME + boys, or rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children. These differences between clinically different groups of children support the view that the etiology of OME can be heterogeneous.',\n 'Characterisation of rubella virus hemagglutinin rosettes. Abstract Purified rubella virus treated with Triton X-100 was subjected to centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient containing nonionic detergent β-D-octylglucoside. The result of this treatment was the formation of hemagglutinating rosettes containing viral glycoproteins VP2 (50,000 mol. wt.) and VP3 (63,000 mol. wt.). The rosettes have a 26 S sedimentation coefficient and a density of 1.2 g/cm3 in sucrose. Electron microscopy revealed 15 nm rosettes with a hollow center. The molecular weight of the rosettes was extrapolated at 850,00',\n 'A sensitive radioimmunoassay for the determination of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus. Abstract A solid-phase radioimmunoassay is described for the detection of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus. Viruses were purified by velocity and isopycnic gradient centrifugation and 96-well plastic plates were coated with viral antigens. To allow the detection of most serotypes of low titered antisera, a pool of antigens from several viral serotypes were employed. The second antibody, an affinity-purified goat antimouse immunoglobulin, detects IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. This assay is more sensitive than either the plaque reduction assay or the commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and proved to be useful for screening mouse colonies for the presence of mouse hepatitis virus, following seroconversion in experimental animals and in the production of monoclonal antibodies to both structural and nonstructural proteins.',\n 'Clones of MRC-C cells may be superior to the parent line for the culture of 229E-like strains of human respiratory coronavirus. Abstract A clone was selected from the MRC-C continuous heteroploid cell line which was significantly better than MRC-C for the culture of human respiratory coronavirus (HCV) 229E, strain LP. Such clones could prove generally useful for the isolation of HCV-229E from clinical specimens, and for the propagation and assay of laboratory adapted strains.',\n 'An enzyme immunoassay for identification and quantification of infectious murine parvovirus in cultured cells. Abstract An enzyme immunoassay was developed to identify and quantify infectious murine parvovirus. The assay was as sensitive as the fluorescent focus test for quantification of virus in clinical material and was less labor-intensive. Viral infectivity could be inactivated with formalin prior to performance of the enzyme immunoassay. Specificity of the reaction product was shown by neutralization of infectivity using a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to murine parvovirus.',\n 'The agents of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis. Abstract Recent studies have provided physicochemical and electron microscopic evidence for the existence of two distinct agents of posttransfusion non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. One of these agents is chloroform-resistant and is not associated with the formation of unique ultrastructural structures in infected liver. The other agent is CHCl3-sensitive, induces the formation of characteristic hepatocyte cytoplasmic tubules, and interferes with concurrent HAV or HBV infection in experimentally inoculated chimpanzees. The tubule-forming agent (TFA) has also been shown to pass through an 80 nm capillary pore membrane filter, suggesting that it is a small enveloped (or lipid-containing) virus. The TFA can also be recovered from low titer (⩽ 105 infectious doses/ml) chronic-phase chimpanzee plasma by use of a multi-step purification procedure that assumes the agent is a small enveloped RNA virus with an approximate buoyant density of 1.24 g/cm3 and a sedimentation coefficient of 200–280 S. The apparent lack of nucleic acid homology between the NANB-TFA and HBV further suggests that the NANB-TFA is either Togavirus-like or belongs to another or as yet undefined class of RNA or DNA virus.',\n \"The use of a random priming procedure to generate cDNA libraries of infectious bronchitis virus, a large RNA virus. Abstract An efficient method for the generation of gene banks from large RNA viruses is described using infectious bronchitis virus as an example. Randomly primed clones have been characterized and found to be representative of the viral genome including 5' leader sequences.\",\n 'A comparison of the susceptibility of three human gut tumour-derived differentiated epithelial cell lines, primary monkey kidney cells and human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line to 66-prototype strains of human enteroviruses. Abstract The growth of prototype strains of 31 serotypes of ECHO, 3 polio, 6 Coxsackie B, 24 Coxsackie A and enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 were tested in parallel in primary monkey kidney cells (PMK), RD cells and three gut tumour-derived differentiated epithelial cell lines (HRT-18 HT-29 in SKCO-1). All 31 serotypes of ECHO viruses grew in HT-29, 27 and SKCO-1, 5 in HRT-18, 29 in PMK and 29 in RD. There was good growth of poliovirus serotypes in all five cell types. Coxsackie B viruses grew well in all the cell lines except RD. Fifteen of the Coxsackie A viruses grew in SKCO-1, 4 in HT-29, 3 in HRT-18 and 7 in RD. Enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 grew only in RD cells after 3 serial passages. These results showed that 2 of the gut tumour-derived cell lines, HT-29 and SKCO-1 had a markedly wider susceptibility, with comparable or wider sensitivity, for enteroviruses, than PMK and RD. While their use for field isolation from clinical samples is not yet fully established HT-29 and SKCO-1 would appear to be ideal for a variety of laboratory manipulations of the majority of enteroviruses.',\n 'Envelope proteins of avian infectious bronchitis virus: Purification and biological properties. Abstract Immunoadsorbents, made with monoclonal antibodies, were used to purify the spike and membrane proteins of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The purified proteins were inoculated into rabbits to produce antisera. The rabbit anti-spike sera neutralized the infectivity of the virus whereas the anti-membrane sera did not. IBV-infected chickens produced antibodies to both the spike and membrane proteins. Both these antibodies were at their highest concentration about 9–11 days after inoculation, whereas neutralizing antibodies were present only at very low concentrations at that time. Neutralizing antibodies were at their highest concentration 21 days after inoculation. A second inoculation of virus at 42 days induced an anamnestic antibody response to the spike and membrane proteins and also for the neutralizing antibodies. The neutralizing, anti-spike and anti-membrane antibodies all reached highest concentrations 7–11 days after this inoculation. The advantages of purifying viral proteins using affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies are discussed.',\n \"The causes of false-positives encountered during the screening of old-world primates for antibodies to human and simian retroviruses by ELISA. Abstract Sera from 526 old-world primates representing 50 different species were screened by ELISA for antibodies to human T-lymphotropic viruses I and III, and simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1). About onefourth of the sera were positive by ELISA. There was a tendency, however, for the same sera to be positive for all three human and simian retroviruses. Only about one in five of the ELISA antibodypositive sera were confirmed to be positive by Western blotting. False-positive ELISA antibody tests were particularly common among sera from mandrills, crab-eating macaques, lion-tailed macaques, African green monkeys, and DeBrazza's and moustached guenons. Sera that were falsely positive in ELISA antibody tests to the three human and simian retroviruses were found to contain antibodies that reacted at comparable intensity with feline leukemia, infectious peritonitis and panleukopenia viruses. The false anti-viral activity of these sera was found to be due to antibodies that reacted with non-viral proteins that were copurified with all five virus preparations. These proteins were present in normal cat and human cells used to grow the various viruses and in gelatin. The implications of nonspecific cell-protein antibodies in primate sera were discussed in the light of this and previous seroepidemiologic studies of man and old-world monkeys.\",\n 'An ion-exchange capture technique for routine identification of faecal viruses by electron microscopy. Abstract Faecal specimens from 520 patients with non-bacterial, gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy using four methods. These were (1) a direct dip method, (2) low-speed centrifugation, (3) ultracentrifugation and (4) a calcium phosphate method. The calcium phosphate method combined with low-speed centrifugation (750 × g, 2,100 × g) was considered overall best. The calcium phosphate method makes it possible to handle a large number of faecal specimens by saving considerable time and labour.',\n 'Two enzyme immunoassays for the detection of antibody to rodent coronaviruses. Abstract Two enzyme immunoassays for detection of antibody to rodent coronaviruses were compared. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain JHM, antigen was in the form of formalin-fixed, infected 17 C1 1 cells. This antigen detected antibody to the homologous strain of MHV as well as to two heterologous MHV strains and a serologically related rat coronavirus, sialodacryodenititis virus. Antibody titers in assays using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated or ureiase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were substantially higher than in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The ureiase assay was somewhat more sensitive than the HRP assay. MHV-JHM antigen was stable under a variety of storage conditions for at least two months.',\n \"Antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus among healthy adult population in China. Abstract This paper deals with a method of using unknown serum as the first antibody to coat wells of the microtiter plate directly in application of the sandwich ELISA method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus. This method was used for assay of the antibody against adult rotavirus in 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China, of which 141 showed a positive result with a total positive rate of 10.2%. The infection rate varied in different regions. In order to confirm the accuracy of these results a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive specimens, and the results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. Seventeen of these 25 positive serum specimens were obtained from rural areas of Qian'an County, Hebei Province where epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred two years ago. The antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus was not detected in 50 adult sera from Xizang Autonomous Region. Only one out of 50 adult sera from Hainan Island was positive for the antibody.\",\n 'An ELISA for the detection of rhinovirus specific antibody in serum and nasal secretion. Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects rhinovirus specific antibody in human sera and nasal secretions, has been developed. This sandwich ELISA utilizes a rabbit antirhinovirus hyperimmune serum as the capture antibody and was found to be very sensitive, detecting rhinovirus specific antibody in the serum at dilutions of 1:106 and 1:103.5 and IgA immunoglobulins, respectively. Thus, this new assay is 102–104 times more sensitive than our standard neutralization test. Furthermore, this increase in sensitivity has enabled us to reliably detect rhinovirus specific immunoglobulins in unconcentrated nasal washings, which are thought to be particularly important for protection against rhinovirus reinfection. A preliminary study of the immune response in human volunteers challenged with rhinovirus using this new ELISA system is presented and further applications and potential of the method are also discussed.',\n 'Trifluorothymidine: potential non-invasive diagnosis of herpes simplex infection using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance in a murine hepatitis model. Abstract Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is known to be concentrated in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in vitro in the form of phosphorylated derivatives. We studied a murine hepatitis model of HSV infection to determine whether this in vitro observation would also be demonstrable in vivo. Following i.v. injection of 100 or 160 mg/kg TFT, TFT was found in significantly higher concentrations in the livers of HSV-2 infected mice than in the livers of uninfected mice, mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) or mice with hepatitis from carbon tetrachloride treatment. Neither altered renal function, nor altered pharmacokinetics could account for this difference. 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy readily detected the 19F from TFT in both liver extracts and whole livers, particularly at higher tissue levels, i.e. > 50 μg/g tissue. If further studies with living animals support these preliminary observations, clinical application could be pursued.',\n 'Development of methods to study the survival of airborne viruses. Abstract A number of viruses have been shown to be transmitted by the airborne route. It is the ability of these viruses to retain their infectivity for living hosts which play a key role in their aerial dissemination. Data generated by a number of workers on the airborne survival of viruses varies considerably because laboratory techniques have not been standardized. About 5 yr ago we started studies on the airborne survival of a number of animal and human viruses. This paper describes the methodology developed to study the aerobiology of these viruses. These methods should be useful in the aerobiological work of other viruses.',\n 'Assessment of intestinal damage in rotavirus infected neonatal mice by a d-xylose absorption test. Abstract A d-xylose absorption test has been standardized for use in newborn mice. It was used to measure small intestine dysfunction in neonate mice following infection with various isolates of rotaviruses. A xylose dose of 1 mg/g body weight was required to produce a maximum level of 100 μg/100 μl of plasma 2 h after administration of d-xylose. The mice inoculated with rotavirus absorbed significantly less d-xylose compared with uninoculated control mice. A micromethod is described which proved to be suitable to quantitate d-xylose for determination of absorptive function of the small intestine in small animals such as newborn mice.',\n 'Evaluation of an immunogold electron microscopy technique for detecting bovine coronavirus. Abstract A solid phase colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (IGEM) technique for detecting bovine coronavirus (BCV) was developed and shown to be specific. This test was compared with three other diagnostic tests using fifteen faecal samples. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 2 samples by direct electron microscopy (DEM), in 3 samples by immunosorbent electron microscopy, in 5 samples by haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination and in 6 samples by IGEM. Ninety four faecal samples were tested by DEM and IGEM. Of 26 samples found to contain BCV by IGEM only 14 were positive by DEM. The IGEM technique is simple, efficient and less susceptible than others to non-specific reactions.',\n \"Detection of enteroviruses using cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes. Abstract This study compares the detection of enterovirus RNA by cDNA probes prepared from both the 5' and 3' end of the genome of coxsackíe A21 and B4 with the use of synthetic oligonucleotides prepared from short but highly conserved sequences in the 5' end non-coding region of the picornavirus genome. The cDNA probes detected enteroviruses with a variable level of sensitivity which presumably depended on the degree of genomic homology with the detecting probes. Generally probes from coxsackievirus A21 detected more enteroviruses than did similar probes from coxsackievirus B4. Probes from the 5' end of the genome of both viruses were more sensitive than 3' end probes. In contrast, synthetic oligonucleotides detected all enteroviruses efficiently suggesting that these probes could be useful as ‘universal’ probes to detect any enterovirus. This paper discusses the application of these probes in the diagnosis and differentiation of enteroviruses.\",\n 'Rapid isolation of morbillivirus nucleocapsid for genomic RNA cDNA cloning and the production of specific core protein antisera. Abstract A procedure is described for the rapid isolation of canine distemper virus nucleocapsid, free from contaminating viral non-core and host cellular proteins. Nucleocapsid isolated in this manner is amenable to ultrastructural evaluation, protein isolation for the production of monospecific hyperimmune serum, and genomic RNA isolation for cDNA cloning. Nucleocapsid (NC) and a defective NC variant (Df-NC) isolated from 5.5 × 107 Vero cells infected with Ond-CDV is readily visualized on cesium gradients. The calculated density for NC is 1.2976 ± 0.0033 g/ml and 1.2458 ± 0.0056 g/ml for Df-NC. Ultrastructurally, NC appears as long uninterrupted strands, 1.6 ± 0.1 μm in length, 21.2 ± 1.7 nm in diameter, with well defined capsid subunits. Df-NC are truncated with a uniform length of 85.8 ± 7.1 nm and a 24.5 ± 1.3 nm diameter. A total of 2.1 ± 0.2 μ of NC protein is obtained for every 1 × 106 cells infected; 89.7% of this mass is represented by a 61 kDa protein (N), 8.4% by a 75 kDa protein (P), and 1.9% by a 160–200 kDa protein (L), which is in agreement with the NC constituency of other paramyxoviruses. Viral N and P proteins, purified by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, were used in the production of hyperimmune serum. Specificity was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were capable of detecting viral antigen in persistently and lytically CDV infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. A single high molecular weight species of nucleic acid was isolated from purified nucleocapsids compatible with a 14.6 kb morbillivirus genome. Although the efficiency of RNA extraction from purified NC was low (14.2%), sufficient RNA was obtained for gel analysis and the establishment of genomic RNA cDNA clones.',\n 'Growth of a murine coronavirus in a microcarrier cell culture system. Abstract The growth of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 on murine DBT cells adapted to dextran-made Cytodex 1 microcarriers was studied in comparison with cells grown on plastic dishes. With a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l in spinner flasks, a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml was reached in 7 days. Under these conditions, cells supported virus growth to the same extent as when they were grown on the plastic substratum. This was shown by a similar development of virus-induced syncytia, the release of an equivalent number of infectious progeny virions per cell, similar recoveries observed after concentration and purification and an identical appearance of the purified virus under the electron microscope. On the other hand, the technical convenience of microcarriers and the ease of scale-up emphasize their potential for the growth of coronaviruses.',\n 'Detection of rhinovirus RNA in nasal epithelial cells by in situ hybridization. Abstract This paper describes the development and evaluation of in situ hybridization (ISH) for the detection of rhinovirus in cells obtained from nasal washings of volunteers infected with human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14). Twenty-five (66%) and 27 (71%) of 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14 had evidence of infection by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one of 4 days investigated after virus challenge. In contrast, only 14 of 38 (37%) volunteers had significant antibody rises as detected by the neutralization test. Of the 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14, only 13 (34%) had symptoms of colds. Of these, 12 (92%) and 10 (77%) were positive by virus isolation or ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Six (46%) had significant antibody rises by neutralization. Similarly, of the 38 volunteers challenged, 22 (58%) were asymptomatic and of these 10 (45.5%) and 12 (54.5%) were positive by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Only 8 (36.4%) of these asymptomatic volunteers showed significant antibody rises by neutralization. There were significant associations between the detection of rhinoviruses by ISH and virus isolation on the third day (P<0.025) after virus challenge in the group as a whole and in the symptomatic group. These results show that generally rhinovirus detection by ISH compares well with virus isolation and both tests are clearly more sensitive than the neutralization test in detecting evidence of infection. It is concluded that ISH is an interesting new technique that may play an important role in the study of rhinovirus infection and pathogenesis.',\n 'Polymerase chain reaction for probe synthesis and for direct amplification in detection of bovine coronavirus. Abstract The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.',\n 'Replication and plaque formation of swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (67N) in swine cell line, SK-K culture. Abstract Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), 67N strain, adapted to suckling mouse brain, grew readily in a porcine cell line, SK-K cell culture with cytopathic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytium formation and detachment of fused cells and round cells from glass surface. After further passages in SK-K cell monolayers with undiluted culture fluid, CPE developed earlier and became complete within 48 h postinoculation (p.i.). Viral specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected SK-K cells by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. The SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed clear plaques on SK-K cell monolayers under simple overlay medium. The plaque assay system for HEV 67N was established by studying various factors influencing the plaque formation in the SK-K cell cultures. By this system more than 106 PFU/0.2 ml of the virus yield was detected in the fluid phase of the infected cultures at 48 h p.i. The SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in 4-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation, but was inhibited by rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. Plaque formation and hemagglutinating activity of the virus were specifically inhibited by antisera against the mouse-passaged and SK-K-passaged 67N virus.',\n 'Analysis of bovine parainfluenza-3 virus replication in bovine embryonic lung cells by indirect fluorescent antibody and hemadsorption assays. Abstract The temporal manifestation of bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI3V) proteins in the cytoplasm and on the surface of bovine embryonic lung (BEL) cells was characterized by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and hemadsorption (HAd) assays. Intracellular proteins appeared earliest at 0.5 h post inoculation (p.i.) and the infection spread to virtually all cells by 48 h p.i. Viral proteins on the surface of cells were seen first at 16 h p.i., and by 48 h p.i. the entire cell monolayer was IFA positive. Hundred-fold less virus in the inoculum delayed appearance of the intracellular as well as cell-surface viral proteins by 24 h and allowed the infection of only about 1 3 of the cells by 48 h p.i. Kinetics of the development in the proportion of HAd-positive cells correlated with those of the surface fluorescence-positive cells. Morphology of the manifestation of BPI3V proteins is characterized by microphotography.',\n 'Protein pI alteration related to strain variation of infectious bronchitis virus, an avian Coronavirus. Abstract Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.',\n 'Improved detection of HSV by electron microscopy in clinical specimens using ultracentrifugation and colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy: Comparison with viral culture and cytodiagnosis. Abstract Three tests were compared to diagnose herpes virus infection: electron microscopy (EM), viral culture (VC) and cytodiagnosis (Tzanck smear). The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a negative VC. Improved EM is discussed for its applicability to special cases that cannot rely on VC and cytodiagnosis or when rapid diagnosis is required.',\n 'Blocking ELISA for distinguishing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV)-infected animals from those vaccinated with a gene-deleted marker vaccine. Abstract A sensitive and specific blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to distinguish infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV)-infected animals from those immunized with a glycoprotein gIII deletion mutant, IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of >0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N <0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper). Most of 116 sera (84%) from feedlot cattle with virus neutralization (VN) titers of < 1:2 or < 1:4 had negative S/N values >0.8, but 18 sera with negative VN titers had positive S/N values, consistent with observations indicating that an IBRV outbreak was occurring in one of the feedlot herds. Thirty nine sera (98%) from feedlot cattle with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:128 had positive S/N values (<0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a borderline (±) S/N value of 0.81. After immunization with a commercial gIII-positive IBRV vaccine, 115 116 sera with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:256 had positive S/N values (<0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a negative S/N value of 0.83. Serum from one vaccinated animal that failed to seroconvert after vaccination (VN < 1:4) showed a strongly positive ELISA S/N of 0.48.',\n 'Type-specific identification of influenza viruses A, B and C by the polymerase chain reaction. Abstract The aim of this study was to develop a polymerase chain reaction for specific detection of influenza A, B, and C RNA genomes. Three primer sets were selected from conserved regions of the genome coding for the non-structural proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A (22 H1N1, 9 H2N2, and 30 H3N2), 11 influenza B, and three influenza C isolates. Specific amplified products were obtained with all these strains after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificity of the reaction was increased by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. When nucleic acids from a variety of micro-organisms from the respiratory tract were subjected to the PCR with these primers, no specific amplified products were generated. The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR. No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these samples. RNA-PCR is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of influenza virus genomes.',\n \"An appraisal of different methods for the detection of the walnut strain of cherry leafroll virus. Abstract Three methods were evaluated for the detection of cherry leafroll virus: ELISA, dot-blot and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot-blot and RT-PCR were carried out in crude plant extracts without any further RNA purification. Dot-blot hybridization using a 32P-labelled DNA probe was as sensitive as previously reported ELISA results for cherry leafroll virus detection. The most sensitive method was RT-PCR, which amplified a specific fragment of 448 bp from the 3' untranslated region of both viral genomic RNAs. RT-PCR was used to detect cherry leafroll virus in infected walnut buds and twigs.\",\n 'Microheterogeneity of S-glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus temperature-sensitive mutants. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (MHV-JHM) is a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute fatal encephalomyelitis in 75–99% of infected mice. The surviving animals may subsequently develop demyelinating disease. We compared the S peplomer protein of the wild type (wt) and five temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of MHV-JHM. In contrast with the wt, none of these five cause fatal disease (mortality less than 10%). Three of these ts mutants did not induce any demyelinating disease, a fourth caused demyelinating disease in 5% of the animals and a fifth, designated ts8, exhibited strong demyelinating properties and caused demyelination in 99% of the animals. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no differences in the molecular weight of S peplomer protein of wt or ts MHV-JHM mutants. However, isoelectric focusing of the S protein of these five ts mutants and the wt MHV-JHM, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose sheets and immunoblotting with anti-S specific antibody revealed significant differences in the microheterogeneity of the S protein.',\n 'Oligonucleotide probes in infectious bronchitis virus diagnosis and strain identification. Abstract Genomic RNA fingerprints of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains M41 and Conn46 were prepared to identify T1 RNase-resistant oligonucleotides ‘unique’ to each of the two IBV strains. Such oligonucleotides were subsequently eluted from the gels and their nucleotide sequences determined. When oligonucleotide probes of those sequences were synthesized and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay, the probes lacked IBV strain-specificity and reacted with the RNAs of homologous as well as heterologous IBV strains. Based on these results, the methods used in this study need to be applied to a large number of oligonucleotide probes, to find one or a few that might be suitable as IBV strain- or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes.',\n 'Optimization of extraction and PCR amplification of RNA extracts from paraffin-embedded tissue in different fixatives. Abstract A method was developed for fast and efficient isolation of RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue sections for subsequent PCR analysis. This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material. These data indicate that paraffin-embedded archival tissue can be used for RT-PCR analysis, adding an important technique to diagnostic pathology and retrospective studies.',\n \"Development and optimization of plaque assays for rat coronaviruses. Abstract Plaque assays under Sephadex or agarose overlays are described for rat coronaviruses (RCVs) grown in L2 mouse fibroblasts. A plaque assay using Sephadex was simple; however, viable plaques could not be collected for propagation, and fixation was necessary before evaluation. Plaque formation under agarose was optimized using diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) in the pre-treatment and absorption media and trypsin added to the absorption media and agarose overlay. The use of DEAE-D alone, trypsin alone or trypsin combined with DEAE-D significantly increased plaque numbers and visibility. Plaque numbers were highest when pre-treatment media contained DEAE-D, absorption media contained DEAE-D and trypsin, and the agarose overlay contained trypsin. The assay was useful for plaque isolation and quantification of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDA), Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV) and other coronavirus isolates from rats and its specificity was demonstrated by plaque-reduction neutralization testing. These methods will facilitate production of cloned virus stocks for study of RCV biology and virus quantification for in vitro and in vivo studies of RCVs.\",\n 'Computer network for a diagnostic virology laboratory. Abstract A data base for a large diagnostic virology laboratory is described. The system uses a network of personal computers. It allows the entry, long-term storage, and subsequent retrieval of specimen and patient records (comprising personal identifiers and specimen and result information), and hard-copy results reporting. Sited entirely within the laboratory, the network is not connected to a modem. Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.',\n 'Genic amplification of the entire coding region of the HEF RNA segment of influenza C virus. Abstract In order to provide an easy and powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment of a recent strain, a combination of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction was used. We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes. A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.',\n 'Enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus Type I infection in cell cultures using low-speed centrifugation. Abstract The effects of centrifugation on the ability of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) to infect cells in culture was investigated. The infectivity titer was the highest when the plates were centrifuged at 400 × g (1500 rpm) for 2 h. All five strains classified as FIPV Type I showed infectivity titers enhanced 10–100-fold by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 h. The centrifugal enhancement of infection was obtained only by centrifugation immediately after inoculation of the virus, suggesting that the enhancement occurs during attachment or adsorption of viruses to the cells. This method may be useful for the culture of FIPV Type I strains.',\n 'Comparative study of a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay for the detection of antibodies to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs. Abstract A blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in pig sera was developed and compared with the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), the most widely used serological diagnostic test in Europe. The blocking ELISA was specific and more sensitive than the IPMA when applied to field sera and to sera which were collected early after an experimental infection with PRRSV. Problems with high background activity as observed in IPMA or indirect ELISA were not encountered.',\n 'Optimization of in vitro growth conditions for enterotropic murine coronavirus strains. Abstract Enterotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains have been difficult to grow in cell culture. In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI- or MHV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.1 cells. Both strains produced titers of 106 TCID50/ml in subsequent passages in J774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.1 cells. Therefore J774A.1 cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.1 cells, MHV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 1469), though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MHV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supernatants.',\n 'Increased viral titers and enhanced reactivity of antibodies to the spike glycoprotein of murine coronavirus produced by infection at pH 6. Abstract Infection of cell monolayers by murine coronavirus A59 at pH 6 rather than 7 yielded a ten-fold increase in the infectious titer and a remarkable enhancement of the reactivities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the spike glycoprotein in immunoblotting, immuno-precipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These observations are very useful for detecting antibodies against the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses and enhancing infectious titers.',\n 'Development and evaluation of an ELISA using recombinant fusion protein to detect the presence of host antibody to equine arteritis virus. Abstract A recombinant glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein expressing amino acids 55–98 of equine arteritis virus (EAV) GL (rGL55–98) was tested in an ELISA for its ability to detect serum antibodies to EAV. Host antibodies induced following EAV infection bound the recombinant antigen by ELISA. The ELISA specificity and sensitivity were determined with a panel of equine sera including postinfection and postvaccination samples. A good correlation existed between EAV neutralizing antibody titers and ELISA absorbance values (r = 0.827). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 99.6 and 90.1%, respectively, compared with the EAV neutralization test and the recombinant antigen did not crossreact in ELISA with equine sera directed against other common equine respiratory viruses. Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested. Following vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, antibody detected with the recombinant antigen ELISA preceded the development of a virus-neutralizing response. The study demonstrates the potential application of rGL55–98 as a diagnostic antigen.',\n 'Detection of human coronavirus 229E-specific antibodies using recombinant fusion proteins. Abstract Human coronaviruses are known to be a common cause of respiratory infections in man. However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The serum samples of the adult group had coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8 51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20 51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavirus infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections.',\n 'In situ hybridization technique for the detection of swine enteric and respiratory coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Abstract The in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was developed to detect the swine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), in cell culture and tissue sections from TGEV-or PRCV-infected pigs. The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP1 and pPSP.FP2 containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.',\n 'Determination of affinities of a panel of IgGs and Fabs for whole enveloped (influenza A) virions using surface plasmon resonance. Abstract The affinity of a panel of neutralizing monoclonal IgGs and their Fab fragments has been measured for the first time with an enveloped type A influenza virus, by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the BIAlite™ instrument. Equilibrium constants could be calculated for four of the five mAbs tested. These were in the nanomolar range. The ranking order was very similar to that obtained with an affinity ELISA, (an equilibrium system) but as others have found, affinities were 2–10-fold lower as measured by SPR (a flow system). No data were obtained with mAb HC58 although it had one of the highest affinities using an ELISA format, and was 28-fold higher than another mAb (HC10) which gave good data by SPR. This may relate to the orientation of its binding on the virion surface. The K dissoc. of the Fabs was only 3–10-fold higher compared to their IgGs. Fab from the lowest affinity IgG (HC10) could not be measured, possibly because it fell below the threshold for detection.',\n 'Host and viral factors that influence viral neurotropism II. Viral genes, host genes, site of entry and route of spread of virus. Abstract In the previous article in this series, we focused on how the interaction between viral cell attachment proteins and receptor molecules on the surface of host target cells played a major role in determining the cell and tissue tropism of many neurotropic viruses. In order to complete our review of viral factors that influence the tropism of viruses for the CNS, we will discuss the role of viral genes that function to specifically enhance the replication of viral proteins in certain cells or tissues (“tissue-specific enhancers and promoters”). We will then examine the ways in which host factors, including specific host genes, can influence resistance or susceptibility to certain types of neurotropic viral infections. Finally, we will conclude by reviewing how factors that involve the interaction of the host and the virus, such as the site of the viral entry and its route and method of spread, can influence the distribution of viral infection within the CNS.',\n 'A viral subunit immunogen for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis. Abstract An immunogenic component was isolated from both the Illinois (propagated in young swine) and the Miller (cell culture-adapted) strains of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus. The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen.',\n 'An effective dosage regimen for prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection by intranasal administration of HuIFN-α 2. Abstract Before the prophylactic effect of human interferon α 2 (HuIFN-α 2) can be tested against naturally acquired rhinovirus infection in a large-scale field trial, it is desirable to show that self-administration of the drug is practical, and to determine the smallest well-tolerated dose likely to produce a worthwhile effect. Here we report that self-administered intranasal interferon can be effective, and show how prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection is affected by both the quantity of interferon, and the interval between a dose and virus challenge. Finally, the medication regimen suggested for use in field trials (3.85 MU 3 times/day) was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in volunteers. Although virus challenge was at a time when those being treated with interferon would be most susceptible, a substantial protective effect was still demonstrated.',\n \"The need for new antiviral agents. Abstract Population density and immune status, vectors and virulence of infection, nutritional status, sanitation, genetic susceptibility and medical management of cases, are important factors influencing the incidence and/or severity of virus infections. Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix.\",\n 'Alphavirus replication in cultured cells and infected animals is inhibited by antiproteinase agents. Abstract The influence of different antiproteinase agents on alphavirus replication was examined. Sindbis virus multicycle replication in cultured cells was suppressed by N-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteinases, and by aprotinin, an inhibitor of a wide spectrum of proteinases. Antiviral activity of TPCK was also demonstrated in Sindbis virus-infected animals. Parenteral injections of TPCK in infected mice reduced virus titers in brain and blood. The possible mechanism(s) of antiviral action of the antiproteinase agents are discussed.',\n 'Bovine interferon: Its biology and application in veterinary medicine. Abstract Investigations of the production and potential use of bovine interferons against viral infections have occurred since the first descriptions of interferons in other systems. The recent advent of recombinant DNA-technology has facilitated such studies and furthered our knowledge about the bovine interferon system in general. This review gives an overview of the biology, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of bovine interferons. Areas in which the interferons are now applied or have potential application in viral diseases in cattle are described. Finally, the value of studies of the bovine interferon system with respect to comparative interferon research is discussed.',\n 'Loss of cytomegalovirus infectivity after treatment with castanospermine or related plant alkaloids correlates with aberrant glycoprotein synthesis. Abstract Many plants contain polyhydroxyalkaloids which are potent inhibitors of glucosidases, enzymes involved in oligosaccharide trimming. These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gp130 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity. As well as being potential targets for antiviral agents against CMV, inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming reactions may define components of the virion surface important for infectivity.',\n \"Mechanism of action of the antiviral compound MDL 20,610. Abstract The purpose of this study was to probe the antirhinovirus (RV) mechanism of action of MDL 20,610. Evaluation of the compound's effects on RV RNA synthesis, uncoating of neutral red-sensitized RV, plasma membrane penetration by RV, stabilization of RV against heat (56°C) and low pH (5.0) inactivation, and studies with MDL 20,610-resistant RV mutants indicate that MDL 20,610 binds directly to the RV capsid with subsequent inhibition of acid-mediated virion uncoating.\",\n 'A study of the efficacy of the bradykinin antagonist, NPC 567, in rhinovirus infections in human volunteers. Abstract In a double-blind placebo controlled trial intranasal NPC 567, a bradykinin antagonist, failed to alleviate the symptoms of experimental rhinovirus colds. Indeed, there was evidence that the drug enhanced the symptoms although no irritant effect was detected on the uninfected nasal mucosa.',\n 'The efficacy of intranasal interferonα-2a in respiratory syncytial virus infection in volunteers. Abstract In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, self-administered intranasal interferonα-2a or placebo was given both before and after challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. The incidence of colds and the severity of signs and symptoms were reduced in those receiving interferonα-2a as compared with those given placebo. In a further double-blind, placebo-controlled study, self-administered interferonα-2a or placebo was given only to those volunteers who developed colds following challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. There was no evidence that interferonα-2a reduced the severity of the signs and symptoms or shortened the duration of the illness. The similarity of these results to the effect of interferonα-2a in rhinovirus infections in volunteers is discussed.',\n 'Prophylactic and therapeutic activities of 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine against Punta Toro virus infections in mice. Abstract The biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine was evaluated in mice against the hepatotropic Adames strain of Punta Toro virus. When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25–100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre- and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controls. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent. Interferon induction appears to be the reason for antiviral activity in this model, since up to 10000 units of interferon/ml were induced in mice 1 h after treatment with 100 mg 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine per kg, and antibody to interferon α/β administered shortly after treatment with the nucleoside negated the antiviral effect.',\n 'A view from the common cold unit. Abstract I have been asked to stand back and describe in broad terms the view I have had of common colds — probably the most frequent of acute human diseases and a long-lasting scientific problem — and in particular our recent work on antivirals. I should be able to do this for two reasons. Like everyone else I have suffered from colds, but in addition I have been studying the problem from the virological and clinical point of view for over 35 years — for the last 31 at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. As a result I may have problems with perspective — it is not possible to give a personal view and at the same time to describe something from every possible angle, and quite impossible to be comprehensive, but I have done my best and readers will make their own judgements and corrections.',\n 'Virucidal effect of murine duodenal extracts: studies with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus. Abstract Mucosal resistance to infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) has been previously demonstrated, and the LDV system presents an important murine model for the study of mucosal barriers to viral infection. In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently non-enzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10–100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10–17 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance.',\n 'Broad-spectrum activity of 8-chloro-7-deazaguanosine against RNA virus infections in mice and rats. Abstract A novel nucleoside analog, 8-chloro-7-deazaguanosine (8-Cl-7-dzGuo), was evaluated for anti-RNA virus activity in rodents in parallel with the related compound 7-deaza-7-thia-8-oxoguanosine (7-dzTOGuo). Half-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of each substance administered 24 and 18 h prior to i.p. virus challenge protected the majority of mice infected with banzi, encephalomyocarditis, San Angelo, and Semliki Forest viruses at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. These compounds at 100 mg/kg/day also protected most suckling rats infected intranasally with rat coronavirus. However, no survival benefit was afforded to treated mice infected intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. 8-Cl-7-dzguo was orally active against Semliki Forest virus in mice at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, whereas 7-dzTOGuo is reported to not be effective orally. In uninfected mice, the two compounds induced similar amounts of interferon following i.p. injections. Interferon was induced by oral treatments with 8-Cl-7-dzGuo but not with 7-dzTOGuo. Fifty percent acute lethal doses to uninfected mice treated i.p. in half-daily doses for one day with 7-deazaguanosine (7-dzGuo), 7-dzTOGuo, and 8-Cl-7-dzGuo were 400, 600 and > 1600 (no mortality at this dose) mg/kg/day, respectively. Daily, i.p. treatments for 14 days with these substances (100 mg/kg/day) showed 7-dzGuo as 100% lethal and the other two substances at not toxic. By virtue of reduced toxicity and oral bioavailability, 8-Cl-7-dzGuo appears to have the greatest clinical potential as an interferon-inducing antiviral agent.',\n 'Inhibition of human adenoviruses by 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate. Abstract Antiviral activities of four Schiff bases of aminohydroxyguanidine, designated ML1, ML4, ATL14 and LK11, were tested against human adenovirus types 5 and 8 (Ad5 and Ad8) in A549 cells by plaque reduction and virus yield reduction methods. Compound ML1 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate gave the best therapeutic indices (TC50/IC50) of 27.2 and 17.8 for Ad5 and Ad8, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with ML1 did not affect the adsorption nor the penetration of virus. Ultrastructure studies showed that only the drug treated infected cells had unidentified irregular shaped electron dense structures that might be drug altered viral macromolecules that were not assembled into complete infectious virus particles. Since these compounds have metal chelating properties, their antiviral activity may involve the early IA (EIA) gene which encodes a viral protein of 289 amino acid which has a zinc finger moiety that is required for its transactivation activity.',\n 'Effect of liposome-encapsulation on immunomodulating and antiviral activities of interferon-γ. Abstract The effect of liposome-encapsulation on the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was evaluated in this study. The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-γ (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-γ or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-γ (LIP-IFN-γ), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-γ. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-γ showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-γ conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LD50 doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-γ. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-γ. Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-γ may provide additional therapeutic advantages by reducing IFN-γ toxicity while prolonging its body retention.',\n 'Transition of the mRNA sequence downstream from the initiation codon into a single-stranded conformation is strongly promoted by binding of the initiator tRNA. Abstract Using an RNA footprinting technique, accessible sites on the mRNA initiation region bound to the ribosome have been determined. Chemical probing experiments have been done both in the presence and absence of the initiator tRNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and carbodiimide as reagent probes. As an mRNA, a mini-mRNA containing the initiation region of bacteriophage λ gene cro has been used. This region is characterized by a long single-stranded Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence followed by two hairpin structures of which the first one comprises in its loop the initiation codon. As compared to a free mRNA, the only nucleotides additionally protected in the binary mRNA-ribosome complex have been those which belong to the S-D sequence and the initiation codon. The protection of other nucleotides has not changed. Addition of the initiator RNA results in the modification of nucleotides in the stems of the downstream hairpin structures of the initiation region. This reflects their transition into a single-stranded conformation promoted by tRNA. A possible implication of these findings for the decoding process is discussed.',\n 'Catalytic site studies on tuna (Thunnus albacares) pyloric caeca aminopeptidase. Abstract Tuna pyloric caeca aminopeptidase (tAP) is a glycosylated zinc-metalloenzyme containing apparently two identical subunits. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit. Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxal and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.',\n 'Altered immune function in demyelinative disease. Abstract Experimentally induced demyelination has an autoimmune origin in some mouse models and is somehow virally induced in others. In June, invited participants in a Kroc Foundation workshop discussed the damaging mechanisms involved and their relevance to an understanding of multiple sclerosis and human encephalomyelitis.',\n 'Genetic and molecular aspects of demyelination. Abstract Three groups of investigators came together to learn from each other in a workshop: neurologists and neuropathologists interested in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinative diseases of man and similar autoimmune and virus-induced model diseases in animals; immunologists and virologists concerned with the genetic controls found to play a role in these diseases; and geneticists and molecular biologists investigating specific gene products and their role in recognition function and cell interactions in model immunological systems.',\n 'The current status of viral immunology. Abstract Many aspects of viral immunity, ranging from the molecular and cellular studies of the interaction between viruses and host cells in vitro and the crystalline structures of the MHC and peptides, to the regulation of pathogenesis in experimental animals and humans were discussed at a recent meeting.',\n 'Epidemiologic approaches used in a herd health practice to investigate neonatal calf mortality. Abstract Epidemiologic methods were applied in an investigation into causes of neonatal mortality on a 1400-cow dairy in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California. A format for collation of information on birthdate and date of death was assembled into a matrix which improved conceptualization of the data and which simplified procedures for estimation of mortality rates. Contemporary and birth cohort life table methods, mortality density estimations and relative risk assessment were used to ascertain if there were high-risk groups of calves that could be identified by age, day-of-the-week born, day-of-the-week died and sex. During the outbreak of neonatal diarrhea on this dairy, female calves were found to have experienced an atypically higher rate of mortality (10.7%) than did males (5.3%). Calves of both sexes died between the ages of 9 and 19 days. In addition, the risk of dying was 11 times greater for calves born on Wednesdays than for those born on Saturdays. These findings formed the basis for recommended changes in management of neonatal calves on the dairy.',\n 'Dairy calf management, morbidity and mortality in Ontario Holstein herds. I. The data. Abstract Heifer calf management practices and clinical outcomes were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. Data were collected at both the farm level (all farms) and the individual calf level (1968 calves, 35 farms). Farm-level management data were collected by means of questionnaires and farm visits. Calf-level management data were recorded by farmers on forms provided. Treatments for disease and mortality data were recorded by the farmers on the calves up to the age of weaning, the age at which calves were no longer fed milk or milk substitutes on a regular basis. Farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year. Farm-level mortality rates per six-month season (winter/summer) were skewed, with a mean of about 6%, a median of zero, and a range of 67%. Morbidity rates were similarly skewed. Four percent of liveborn heifer calves died, 20% were treated for scours, and 15% were treated for pneumonia before the age of weaning. Stated farm policies on calf rearing were implemented to varying degrees on different farms, as estimated from individual calf data. This posed particular problems for interpreting farm-level data, since the danger of committing an ecologic fallacy was high. The data set described in this paper formed the basis for an observational study of the interlationships of heifer calf management and clinical outcomes.',\n 'Dairy calf management, morbidity and mortality in Ontario Holstein herds. III. Association of management with morbidity. Abstract Associations between heifer calf management and morbidity, particularly scours and pneumonia, were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Farm size, and policies related to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice water and minerals to calves, methods of feeding, and the use of medicated feeds significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median pneumonia rates. Farm policies with regard to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice salt to calves, age at teat removal, type of calf housing, and use of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median scours rates. Scours and pneumonia were significantly associated with each other at both the farm and the calf level. No significant associations were found between individual calf management practices and the odds of being treated for scours. Sire used, method of first colostrum feeding, navel treatment, use of anti-scour vaccine in the dam, and the administration of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a calf being treated for pneumonia.',\n 'Dairy calf management, morbidity and mortality in Ontario Holstein herds. IV. Association of management with mortality. Abstract Associations between heifer calf management and mortality were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying. However, several interactions entered the statistical models, and the effects of those management practices were not all straightforward.',\n 'Certain enteropathogens in calves of Finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of diarrhea. Abstract The occurrence and distribution of certain enteropathogenic organisms and the manifestation of diarrhea, especially in relation to colostral management, were studied in neonatal calves of eight southern Finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of enteric disturbances. The fecal samples were obtained from the calves and were provided by the farmers. Potentially pathogenic agents were demonstrated in 52 of the 68 calves studied. Cryptosporidium was found in 36 of them while rotavirus was found in 29 and Escherichia coli in 15 of them, either singly or in combination. Salmonella, coronavirus or parvovirus were not detected in any of the calves. Twenty-six of the 36 calves contracted their Cryptosporidium infection and 18 of the 29 calves their rotavirus infection within the first week of life. Eighteen of the 52 infected calves developed diarrhea of microbial origin within 20 days of age; the most frequent finding was mixed infection with Cryptosporidium and rotavirus. In addition there were six diarrheic calves where no infection could be demonstrated. Only 10 of the 68 calves had neither infections nor diarrhea. There was a highly significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the uninfected non-diarrheic and diarrheic calves and a significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the subclinically infected and diarrheic calves. The importance of sucking of colostrum at the first feeding was observed. The smallest amount protecting the calves from infections was 0.75 1 given within 1 h of delivery.',\n 'Identification of selected disease agents from calves on Costa Rican tropical cloud-forest dairy farms. Abstract Rotavirus, K99+ E. coli and coccidia were identified from feces of 10%, 13% and 37% of 300 selected dairy calves ⩽3 months of age, and from 26%, 36% and 45% of 42 Costa Rican dairy farms, respectively. Calf breeds were Holstein 68%, Jersey 27% and other breeds 5%. Median calf ages at identification of rotavirus, K99+ E. coli and coccidia were 14.5, 15, and 3 days, respectively. Differences between isolation rates for the wet and dry season were not statistically significant for any of the three agents. Prevalence of antibodies against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus were 7% and 82%, respectively, for selected calves. Of calf sera tested for immunoglobulins, 9.5% were negative.',\n 'Detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus infection-associated antigen antibodies: comparison of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and agar gel immunodiffusion tests. Abstract A liquid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was compared with the standard agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) to identify and quantify antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus infection-associated (VIA) antigen. A total of 3181 cattle sera were tested. Of these sera, 1885 were from cattle which had not been exposed to FMD. A total of 1296 sera were either from cattle which were experimentally exposed to FMD virus or from cattle involved in field outbreaks. The results indicate that the ELISA has the same specificity as the AGID test, but is more efficient in detecting cattle exposed to FMD virus. The ELISA technique will probably prove to be a more satisfactory test in support of the prevention, control and eradication programs for the disease.',\n 'Seroprevalence of porcine respiratory coronavirus infection in Spanish breeding sows. Abstract The seroprevalence of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) among breeding sows was estimated in Castilla y León, the largest region in Spain, by a cross-sectional study. Serum samples (1247) were taken from sows from 58 different herds for this purpose throughout 1988 and were tested by a monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA (MACELISA), a test which detects antibodies to both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV. In order to discriminate positive sera to both coronaviruses, a blocking inhibition ELISA was used for all MACELISA-positive sera. By MACELISA, 31.4% of sera tested were positive and all of them were confirmed specifically as PRCV-positive by blocking inhibition ELISA, thus ruling out the presence of TGEV in the sampled area: 64% of the farms had at least one PRCV-seropositive sow, indicating that the infection was widespread Farms were classified into three categories, according to size and management practices. No significant differences were found in the prevalence rates among the three farm types; there was, however, a highly significant correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity.',\n 'The role of pathogenic Escherichia coli in the etiology of veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis. Abstract Veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis, a condition that has no identified specific etiology, is a fatal syndrome of veal calves and has recently become a major concern of the veal calf industry in the midwestern United States. To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces STa were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P<0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between STa production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.',\n 'Seroprevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection among different types of breeding swine farms in Spain. Abstract A cross-sectional study for determining the seroprevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection among swine breeding farms in the Castilla y León region (Spain) was carried out. Breeding farms were stratified according to size and type of production (intensive or extensive). The number of farms to be sampled in each stratum was calculated from the latest census data available and the prevalence of seropositive farms obtained in other countries. Within each herd, the number of sows needed to detect the presence of the disease were sampled, according to within-herd seroprevalence data obtained by us in previous studies. A total of 5098 sow serum samples from 794 different farms were collected during 1992–1993 and tested for the presence of PEDV-specific antibodies, using a blocking ELISA with monoclonal antibodies; 55.9% of herds had at least one positive animal; 29.6% of sera were positive. Seropositive farms were detected throughout the sampled region, indicating that the infection was widespread. Higher farm-level prevalence rates were found in farms with more than 20 sows compared with small ones (≤ 20 sows) and in intensive than in extensive herds. On the other hand, within-farm seroprevalence and mean blocking percentage of positive sera decreased with increasing size of the farm.',\n 'Porcine respiratory coronavirus spread in Catalunya, Spain, a previously infection-free area. Abstract A retrospective study of sera from seven commercial pig herds was conducted from May 1985 to July 1989, showing that antibodies against Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV) were first detected in Spain in September 1986. During 1991 a stratified sampling of breeding herds was conducted to establish prevalence to PRCV or Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) infections in Catalunya (northeast Spain). An antibody-capture ELISA was used for PRCV- and/or TGEV-antibodies, while a competitive inhibition ELISA tested for TGEV-specific antibodies. This study revealed 91.1% positive sera and 96.7% positive farms to PRCV and/or TGEV with a gradual increase in prevalence during 1991, which was more noticeable in small herds. Of the total 569 herds tested, 65.2% were positive only to PRCV, 8.6% were positive to TGEV and 22.8% had mixed infections. The first appearance of antibodies coincided with large importation of feeder pigs from Belgium and Holland. This prevalence is much higher than previously reported in other regions of Spain.',\n \"The prevalence of some economically important swine diseases in farrowing units in southwestern Finland. Abstract The prevalence and geographical distribution of some economically important swine diseases were surveyed in 114 randomly selected farrowing units which had a contract with Southwestern Finland's Cooperative Slaughterhouse (LSO) for producing feeder pigs to be delivered to the all in-all out finishing units. The focus was on infectious diseases which could be transmitted to the finishing units with delivered growers, and which might have some influence on partial carcass condemnations (PCC) in meat inspection. Farm visits were done by a veterinarian (senior author) assisted by a technician. Colostrum samples (average 22 per herd) were taken in 100 herds, and analyzed for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleur) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hyo) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Only nine of 114 herds were judged to be free of mange. It was concluded that all finishing units received mange-infected feeder pigs each time the unit was filled. One or more acute erysipelas outbreaks had occurred in every fifth herd during the previous year. The risk of a finishing unit receiving feeder pigs carrying erysipelas was considered to be high. Swine dysentery (Serpulina hyodysenteriae) was not found to be a problem in the LSO area. Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis was found in eight (7%) herds. Seven of these herds were located in those supply areas where the PCC percentage of feeder pigs was high. In spite of statistical connection no causality between this disease and PCC was presumed. There were no previous diagnoses of respiratory diseases but spontaneous coughing was observed in 5% of the herds. Provocation testing induced coughing in 22% of herds but not serious coughing in any herd. Managers had observed coughing in 15% of herds. Ninety-one herds were positive in a colostrum ELISA for A. pleur antibodies, and eight herds were positive for M.hyo antibodies. A.pleur-positive herds had several positive or samples suspected of being positive in each herd bu M.hyo-positive herds had only one or two positive or suspected samples per herd. Six of the M.hyo herds were located in the high PCC area, two in the average PCC area and none in the low PCC area. M.hyo was suggested to be one of the possible explanations for geographical variation of PCC. Atrophic rhinitis was not considered to be of importance in LSO.\",\n 'Management and demographic factors associated with seropositivity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus in US swine herds, 1989–1990. Abstract Serum neutralization testing was used to determine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) titers of up to 10 sows per herd (mean 8.7, median 10) for 392 herds that participated in the 3 month monitoring of sows and litters in the National Swine Survey. Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative. For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows. In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1: 8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under 1: 8 (n = 178). Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs. After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100–199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P<0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively). There was some evidence (P = 0.08) of an increased risk of seropositivity when there were more than two swine herds within a 3 mile radius of the study herd.',\n 'Risk factors associated with seropositivity to porcine respiratory coronavirus in Danish swine herds. Abstract Serological screening of swine herds in 1984 indicated that porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) had been introduced into Denmark. To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR = 4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd size, were subsequently identified. The PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds was found to be related, and closeness of a seropositive herd was associated with an increased risk of a herd being serologically positive. The results of this study indicate that herd size may be an important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection, and that herd size may modify the effect of other risk factors.',\n 'Prophylaxis using paromomycin of natural cryptosporidial infection in neonatal kids. Abstract The chemoprophylactic effects of paromomycin sulfate against natural cryptosporidiosis in young kids were investigated. Two studies were carried out using two groups of 18 and 12 animals in two pens. In each pen, kids were allocated to treated or control groups. The treatment consisted of oral paromomycin given at 100 mg kg−1 body weight day−1 for 11 consecutive days from 2 days of age. All kids were weighed at 2, 6 and 10 days of age. Infection was monitored by collecting fecal samples and staining fecal smears every 3–4 days from days 4 or 5 to days 15 or 19. The results clearly showed the efficacy of paromomycin in reducing cryptosporidial oocyst output. Moreover, paromomycin prevented clinical signs and mortality.',\n 'Dose-dependent effects of specific egg-yolk antibodies on diarrhea of newborn calves. Abstract In a field trial on a farm in Turkey, we tested whether specific egg-yolk antibodies had a prophylactic effect on neonatal diarrhea. Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n = 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n = 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n = 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.',\n 'Descriptive epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in Minnesota dairy heifer calves. Abstract A prospective study was carried out on 845 heifer calves born during 1991 on 30 Holstein dairy farms in southeast Minnesota. The objectives of the study were to describe the epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves from birth to 16 weeks of age (with an emphasis on respiratory disease), to examine individual calf and herd management practices as risk factors for calf morbidity and mortality, and to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Incidence rates for all morbidity, enteritis, and pneumonia were 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 cases per 100 calf-days at risk for the period of the study. Risk of enteritis was highest in the first 3 weeks of life, with pneumonia risk highest at 10 weeks of age. Case fatality rates averaged 11.8%, 17.9%, and 9.4% for all diagnoses, enteritis, and pneumonia, respectively. Average daily rates of gain from birth to 16 weeks of age differed between farms that had inadequate calf housing (0.8 kg day−1) versus those with adequate calf housing (1.0 kg day−1). Approximately half of the calves in the cohort (418) had blood samples taken monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. Of the calves sampled, only 19 calves showed a four-fold rise in serum titers to respiratory viruses. Sixteen calves seroconverted to BVDV, two calves to IBRV, and one calf to PI3 virus. Of 98 calves less than 10 days of age tested for adequacy of passive transfer, 35 (35.7%) had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 800 mg dl−1. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between calves that had adequate passive transfer and those that did not. The incidence of mortality was 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk; 64 calves died during the 16 months of the study. The risk of death was highest at 2 weeks of age. Enteritis was the most common cause of death (28 deaths, 44% of all deaths) followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 30% of all deaths). Comparing producer diagnosis of mortality with necropsy results yielded sensitivities of 58.3% and 56% and specificities of 93% and 100% for producer diagnoses of enteritis and pneumonia, respectively. The kappa statistic comparing producer diagnosis with necropsy result was 0.47. The most common pathogens isolated from calves that died of enteritis were rotavirus (five calves), and Escherichia coli (four calves). Pathogens isolated from pneumonic lungs included Pasteurella multocida (three calves), Haemophilus somnus (three calves), and Pasteurella haemolytica (one calf).',\n 'Effect of preweaning feeding of pasteurized and nonpasteurized milk on postweaning weight gain of heifer calves on a Californian dairy. Abstract The effect of preweaning feeding of pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk on postweaning performance of dairy heifers on a dairy in the Central Valley of California was investigated as an extension of a clinical trial examining the effect of preweaning growth and morbidity on performance at weaning. Of the 150 heifer calves originally enrolled in the field trial, 115 calves (59 treatment, 56 controls) were followed to about 6 months of age, during which time their weights were measured. After weights were adjusted for several potential risk factors and effect modifiers, calves fed pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk were 3.7 kg heavier at 180 days of age than those fed nonpasteurized colostrum and nonpasteurized milk.',\n 'Domestication and the behavior-genetic analysis of captive populations. Abstract Captive environments are believed to produce behavioral changes in animal populations that may limit our ability to generalize back to natural populations. These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are “degenerate”; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating disease X. A Schwannoma-L-2 somatic cell hybrid persistently yielding high titres of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM. Abstract Following infection of RN2 rat Schwannoma cells with unfiltered JHMV inocula, a cell line with an altered phenotype evolved, which was shown to be a somatic cell hybrid of RN2 and mouse L-2 cells. This cell line, EJ, persistently yields JHMV at titres greater than 106 pfu/ml and does not show the suppression of virus production at 39.5 °C that is characteristic of a persistently infected RN2 line. Intracellular viral nucleocapsids are demonstrated. Cloning of EJ hybrids yields cell lines that show a variety of responses to infection by JHMV or MHV3.',\n 'Kupffer and endothelial liver cell damage renders A/J mice susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus type 3. Abstract Damage to the Kupffer and endothelial cells of the liver sinusoids induced by the administration of sublethal doses of frog virus 3 (FV 3) renders A/J mice which are genetically resistant to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV 3) highly susceptible to this virus. Liver histopathology of these animals revealed typical necrotic foci containing MHV 3-specific antigens. FV 3-pretreated mice, after MHV 3 infection, showed higher levels of serum transaminase (GPT) than controls, and MHV 3 replicated more rapidly and to higher titres. Our results bear out the important role of the liver sinusoidal lining in protecting against hepatocyte infection and its direct involvement in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV 3 infection.',\n 'Measles virus gene expression in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Abstract RNA was extracted from the diseased brain of a case of human subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and analysed for the expression of measles-specific RNA. Measles virus-specific mRNAs were present, but the amount of matrix (M) protein mRNA was greatly reduced in comparison to lytically infected cells and phospho- (P) protein mRNA was hardly detectable whereas the level of the corresponding intermediate-sized (is-) RNA was greatly increased. RNA obtained from the human brain was also translated in vitro and measles virus nucleocapsid and P protein was produced. However, in marked contrast to control reactions M protein was not detected in the products formed by translation in vitro. These results indicate an impaired measles virus M protein mRNA synthesis in infected brain tissue.',\n \"Sequence of the membrane protein gene from avian coronavirus IBV. Abstract cDNA clones prepared from genomic RNA of coronavirus IBV have been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence for the complete 5' region of mRNA C, which is not present in mRNAs A and B, has been determined. A sequence of 1224 bases is presented which contains a long open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of molecular weight 25 443. This is in agreement with the molecular weight of 23 000 reported for the unglycosylated form of the membrane polypeptide.\",\n \"Avian infectious bronchitis virus genomic RNA contains sequence homologies at the intergenic boundaries. Abstract cDNAs derived from the 3'-terminus of IBV Beaudette genomic RNA by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription were cloned in PAT153/HB101. 25 clones were characterised and two of these were found to cover 3.3 kb extending from the poly(A) tail. The relationships of the two smallest IBV mRNAs, A and B, to the cloned sequences were established by restriction fragment hybridisation to Northern blots. The 5'-termini of mRNAs A and B were located on the clones by S1 mapping. DNA sequencing of cloned sequences corresponding to the intergenic boundaries of mRNAs A and B was carried out. Homologies between the sequences at these boundaries were observed.\",\n 'Replication and morphogenesis of avian coronavirus in Vero cells and their inhibition by monensin. Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was adapted to Vero cells by serial passage. No significant inhibition of IBV replication was observed when infected Vero cells were treated with α-amanitin or actinomycin D. In thin sections of infected cells, assembly of IBV was observed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and mature IBV particles were located in dilated cisternae of the RER as well as in smooth cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition to typical IBV particles, enveloped particles containing numerous ribosomes were identified at later times postinfection. Monensin, a sodium ionophore which blocks glycoprotein transport to plasma membranes at the level of the Golgi complex, was found to inhibit the formation of infectious IBV. In thin sections of infected Vero cells treated with the ionophore, IBV particles were located in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, but fewer particles were found when compared to controls. A similar pattern of virus-specific proteins was detected in control or monensin-treated IBV-infected cells, which included two glycoproteins (170000 and 24000 daltons) and a polypeptide of 52000 daltons. These results suggesl lhal the ionophore inhibits assembly of a virus which malures at intracellular membranes.',\n 'Antigenic variation among murine coronaviruses: Evidence for polymorphism on the peplomer glycoprotein, E2. Abstract A panel of 28 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against the structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus-4, strain JHM (MHV-4) was used in three antigen binding assays to determine the extent of antigenic homology among six strains of murine coronaviruses. The antigenic determinants studied were highly conserved on the E1 glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all strains tested. In contrast, antigenic polymorphism was observed among the E2 glycoproteins. Of three previously described antigenic determinants against which neutralizing antibodies are directed, only one, termed A(E2), was conserved on all strains. Antigenic site B(E2) was found only on the strongly neurotropic MHV-4 and site C(E2) was present on the virulent MHV-4 and MHV-3 (hepatotropic) strains, but absent on the weakly pathogenic MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S strains. Four non-neutralizing antibodies against at least one topographically distinct antigenic determinant, which we previously designated D(E2), gave binding patterns consistent with two distinct sites. One of these was present on all MHV strains tested and the other was present on all strains except MHV-S. These non-neutralizing antigenic sites were redesignated E(E2) and D(E2) respectively.',\n \"Characterization of leader-related small RNAs in coronavirus-infected cells: Further evidence for leader-primed mechanism of transcription. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, replicates in the cytoplasm and synthesizes 7 viral mRNAs containing an identical stretch of leader RNA sequences at the 5'-end of each RNA. The leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70–82-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.\",\n 'Inhibitory effect of papaverine on RNA and protein synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus. Abstract Papaverine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells approximately 100-fold if added to cultures at a concentration of 30 μM before and after virus infection. The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases XII. Persistence and expression of corona JHM vims functions in RN2-2 Schwannoma cells during latency. Abstract The coronavirus JHMV persistently infects rat Schwannoma cells RN2-2 at 32.5°C and enters a host-imposed reversible, latent state at 39.5°C. JHMV can remain up to 20 days in the latent state and about 14 days before the cultures lose the capacity to resume virus production upon return to 32.5°C. Although persistently and latently infected RN2-2 cells display resistance to superinfection by a heterologous agent VSV, these cells do not release detectable soluble mediators (e.g., interferon) of the antiviral state. Nevertheless, RN2-2 cells are competent to synthesize and release interferon when treated with the appropriate inducers. These observations suggest that interferon does not play any role or may not be the major factor in the control of latency in the Schwannoma cell. Hybridization with virus-specific cDNAs shows that all viral mRNAs are present during latency and that viral mRNAs are present in the polysomes of infected cells at 39.5°C. Western immunoblotting with hybridoma antibodies demonstrates that viral specific proteins are produced at the restrictive temperature. These results',\n 'Bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin protein. Abstract Treatment of purified bovine coronavirus (Mebus strain) with pronase destroyed the integrity of virion surface glycoproteins gp140, gp120, gp100, reduced the amount of gp26 and destroyed the hemagglutinating activity of the virus. Bromelain, on the other hand, destroyed the integrity of gp120, gp100 and gp26 but failed to remove gp140 and failed to destroy viral hemagglutinating activity. These experiments suggest that gp140 is the virion hemagglutinin. Immunoblotting studies using monospecific antiserum demonstrate that gp140 is a disulfide-linked dimeric structure reducible to monomers of 65 kDa.',\n 'Multiple sites of recombination within the RNA genome of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Abstract Recombinant foot-and-mouth disease viruses were isolated from cells infected with a mixture of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants belonging to different subtype strains. In order to select for recombination events in many different regions of the genome, crosses were performed between various pairs of mutants, with ts mutations in different regions of the genome. ts + progeny were analysed by electrofocusing virus-induced proteins and RNase T1 fingerprinting of their RNA. All but 5 out of 43 independent isolates, from nine crosses, proved to have recombinant RNA genomes. Maps of these genomes, based on a knowledge of the locations of the unique oligonucleotides, were constructed. Most could be interpreted as being the products of single genetic cross-overs, although three recombinants were formed by two cross-overs each. Cross-overs in at least twelve distinct regions of the genome were identified. This evidence of a large number of recombination sites suggests that RNA recombination in picornaviruses is a general, as opposed to a site-specific, phenomenon.',\n 'Structural proteins of human respiratory coronavirus OC43. Abstract The human respiratory coronavirus OC43 was grown on a human rectal tumor cell line and was isotopically labeled with amino acids, glucosamine, and orthophosphate to analyze virion structural proteins. Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated; (4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130, 55 and 26 kDa species can therefore be designated P, H, N and M, respectively. They exist in molar ratios of 4:1: 33 : 33, and are calculated to be present at the rate of 88, 22, 726, and 726 molecules per virion, respectively.',\n 'The peplomer protein sequence of the M41 strain of coronavirus IBV and its comparison with Beaudette strains. Abstract The amino acid sequence of the gene for the peplomer protein of the vaccine strain M41 and the Beaudette laboratory strain M42-Salk of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been derived from cDNA sequences. As found with other coronaviruses, the peplomer protein carries the epitopes eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The gene encodes a primary translation product of 1162 amino acids with a molecular weight of 128079. The use of a recent algorithm to predict membrane-protein interactions led to the unambiguous localization of the signah peptide and a transmembrane anchor α-helix at the C-terminus. At 50 positions amino acid differences were found between M41 and two Beaudette strains (M42-Salk and M42-Houghton). They are partly clustered in two regions of the protein. These two regions are candidates for neutralization epitopes of the protein.',\n 'Coronavirus IBV: Partial amino terminal sequencing of spike polypeptide S2 identifies the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg at the cleavage site of the spike precursor propolypeptide of IBV strains Beaudette and M41. Abstract The spike protein of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus comprises two glycopolypeptides S1 and S2 derived by cleavage of a proglycopolypeptide So, the nucleotide sequence of which has recently been determined for the Beaudette strain (Binns M.M. et al., 1985, J. Gen. Virol. 66, 719–726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 μg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G. Boursnell et al. (1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) in the nucleotide sequence of M. The N-terminus of the nucleocapsid (n) polypeptide appeared to be blocked.',\n 'Coronavirus IBV glycopolypeptides: locational studies using proteases and saponin, a membrane permeabilizer. Abstract [35S]methionine-labelled avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (strain 41) and its purified protein components and virions of IBV-Beaudette were incubated with 10 proteases. Several proteases hydrolysed all or some of the membrane glycopoly-peptide (M; M r 30K) and removed about 1.3K of peptide from the amino-(N-)-terminus plus both glycans, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal analysis of [3H]isoleucine-labelled M after hydrolysis by bromelain revealed that the first nine residues had been removed. After the virions had been permeabilised with saponin, a further 2.5K decrease in molecular weight was produced and this was shown to be from the carboxy-(C-)terminus. When considered with the hydropathicity plot analysis of the amino acid sequence of M (Boursnell, M.E.G. et al., 1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) these results suggest that as few as 9–20 N-terminal amino acid residues may protrude at the outer membrane surface and that there is a highly protease sensitive sequence of an estimated 20–25 residues at the C-terminus of M exposed in the lumen of the virion. S2 but not SI was cleaved to a major glycopolypeptide of approximately 71K by several proteases, and to 76K by trypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the 71K glycopolypeptide revealed that it had the same N-terminus as intact S2. After hydrolysis in the presence and absence of saponin it was concluded that S2 is very sensitive to hydrolysis near its carboxy terminus at residues close to the outer membrane surface.',\n 'Inhibition of the assembly of Newcastle disease virus by monensin. Abstract Monensin inhibits the intracellular transport of the glycoproteins of Newcastle disease virus between cis and trans Golgi stacks of infected BHK cells, as evidenced by its effect upon their post-translational modifications such as fatty acid acylation, glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage. Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523–538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.',\n 'MHV nucleocapsid synthesis in the presence of cycloheximide and accumulation of negative strand MHV RNA. Abstract We have found that genomic RNA synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), in agreement with previously published results (Sawicki S.G. and Sawicki D.L. (1986) J. Virol. 57, 328–334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was incorporated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour. Negative strand RNA is the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic positive strand RNA, and would be predicted to accumulate primarily during the early phases of the lytic cycle. In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5–6 h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h. In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5–6-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly by blocking the formation of negative strand templates.',\n 'The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV): comparison with the sequence of the peplomer protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Abstract The amino acid sequence of the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been derived from the cloned cDNA sequence. The gene encodes a protein of 1447 amino acids with a molecular weight of 159 574. Comparison with the primary structure of the peplomer protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (de Groot et al., 1987b) revealed one domain, from amino acids 1 to 274, in which the nucleotide homology was 39%, whereas in the second domain (from residues 275 to 1447) the homology was 93%.',\n 'Response of genetically susceptible and resistant mice to intranasal inoculation with mouse hepatitis virus JHM. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM infection was studied in genetically susceptible (BALB/cByJ) and resistant (SJL/J) mice following intranasal inoculation at 1, 3, 6 or 12 wk of age. Markers of infection included histology, immunohistochemistry, virus quantification and virus serology. All BALE mice developed severe disseminated disease with high mortality due to encephalitis and hepatitis. Peak MHV titers appeared in brain, liver, spleen and intestine on days 3 or 5. Age at inoculation did not influence virus titers in brain, spleen or intestine, but virus titers in liver were inversely proportional to age at inoculation. In 6-wk-old BALE mice, virus was cleared from spleen, intestine and liver by day 30 and from brain by day 60. In intestine, MHV was localized to lymphoid tissue, without fecal excretion. SJL mice of all ages developed remarkably milder disease with low mortality occurring only among mice inoculated at 1 wk of age. SJL mice inoculated at 1 wk had disseminated infection at day 3, but lesions and antigen were cleared from most organs by day 5. Mice inoculated at 3 and 6 wk of age had minimal or no involvement of peripheral organs, and mice inoculated at 12 wk of age had infections restricted to the nose. At day 5, MHV titers in brain, liver, spleen and intestine were significantly lower or undetectable in SJL mice of all ages compared to age-matched BALB mice. In 6-wk-old mice, MHV was cleared from all organs by day 10. Serum antibody titers to MHV were many-fold higher in BALB mice, compared to SJL mice, which mounted only a modest response.',\n 'Mapping of three antigenic sites on the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of Newcastle disease virus. Abstract Nine neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), each of which react with the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of the Beaudette C strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), have been used in competitive binding assays to delineate three non-overlapping antigenic sites A, B and C. Epitopes within these sites have been identified on the basis of cross-reactivity of MAb-resistant mutants against the panel of MAbs, determined by plaque assays and Western blotting. Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347–460 for site A, 284–325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope. The apparent molecular mass of the HN glycoprotein of one mutant was increased from 72 to 75 kDa. This correlates well with the creation of an additional potential glycosylation site in this mutant from Asn-Ser-Pro(325) to Asn-Ser-Ser(325).',\n 'Regulation of varicella zoster virus gene 27 translation in vitro by upstream sequences. Abstract Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) gene 27 transcripts in infected cells. The SalI-G DNA fragment, located in the unique long segment of the VZV genome and containing overlapping genes 26 and 27, was analyzed in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Translation of RNA transcribed from these open reading frames showed prominent expression of gene 27. Four different subclones were constructed to contain gene 27 with and without 100 base pairs (bp) of upstream sequences. Translation of RNA from these constructs using wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate indicated that the sequences upstream from the predicted intiation codon (AUG) of gene 27 downregulated the expression of this gene at the level of translation and that the predicted AUG within gene 27 was preferentially used.',\n 'Growth pattern of various JHM coronavirus isolates in primary rat glial cell cultures correlates with differing neurotropism in vivo. Abstract The JHM strain of murine hepatitis coronavirus is neurotropic in rats, causing either fatal acute encephalomyelitis or subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. We have examined the growth properties of three JHM virus isolates in primary rat glial cultures and found a correlation with their ability to cause disease. Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines. The genetic basis of JHM virus persistence can be explained at the level of direct virus-glial cell interactions.',\n 'Amino acids within hypervariable region 1 of avian coronavirus IBV (Massachusetts serotype) spike glycoprotein are associated with neutralization epitopes. Abstract The spike glycoprotein (S) gene of IBV codes for a precursor protein which is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 glycopolypeptides. The S1 glycopolypeptide, which induces neutralizing antibody, comprises approximately 520 amino acid residues. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of S1 of seven strains of the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype and the first 337 bases of two additional Mass strains. Despite the fact that the strains had been isolated over three decades in Europe and the U.S.A. there was only 4% base and 6% amino acid variation within the group. Nearly one third of the 32 amino acid differences in S1 were in two hypervariable regions (HVRs 1 and 2) comprising residues 38–51 and 99–115, identified by Niesters et al. (1986), showing that HVRs 1 and 2 are a feature of the Mass serotype. Amino acid variation within HVRs 1 and 2 was 29% and 40% respectively. Five vaccine strains could be distinguished from each other by sequencing of the first 337 nucleotides. Variants of M41 which resisted neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies (A13 and A38) had the same, single base change at position 134, resulting in substitution of proline residue 45 by histidine. This indicates that residues within HVR 1 are associated with epitopes which induce neutralizing antibody.',\n 'Antigenic structure of the E2 glycoprotein from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. Abstract The antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus E2 glycoprotein has been defined at three levels: antigenic sites, antigenic subsites and epitopes. Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.',\n 'Pathogenicity of glycoprotein C negative mutants of herpes simplex virus type 1 for the mouse central nervous system. Abstract A previous study from our laboratory showed that a mutant of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), strain KOS-321, carrying a deletion in the structural gene for glycoprotein C (gC) had reduced pathogenicity for the mouse central nervous system when compared to the wild-type virus (Kümel et al., 1985). In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.',\n 'Pneumovirus-like characteristics of the mRNA and proteins of turkey rhinotracheitis virus. Abstract Electronmicroscopy has indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), the causative agent of an acute repiratory disease in turkeys, is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. To determine if TRTV belongs to one of the three defined genera of this family (Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus) we have analysed the RNA and proteins induced during replication of TRTV in Vero cells. Following replication in the presence of actinomycin D 10 polyadenylated RNA bands, ranging in M r from 0.22 to 2.0 × 106, were detected in infected cells; some bands probably contained 2 or more RNA species. Viral proteins were studied after radiolabelling in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine. Comparison of the polypeptides in mock-infected and infected cells, virions and nucleocapsids and after lentil-lectin chromatography and immunoprecipitation revealed seven virus-specific polypeptides (p), some of which were glycosylated (gp): gp82 (M r 82K), gp68, gp53, gp15, p43, p40 and p35. These are considered to be analogous to the large glycopolypeptide (HN, H and G), fusion protein precursor F0, the F protein cleavage products F1 and F2, nucleocapsid (N), phosphorylated (P) and matrix (M) polypeptides, respectively, of the Paramyxoviridae. Two other polypeptides (M r 200K and 22K) were also detected, as was a glycopolypeptide of M r 97K, probably related to gp82. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53 and gp15 but gp82 was little affected, most glycans still being present on a glycopolypeptide of approximately 79K. This finding, indicating that gp82 has mostly O-linked glycans, considered with the mRNA profile and the molecular weight of the N protein shows that of the three genera in this family, TRTV most closely resembles the Pneumovirus genus.',\n 'Temporal regulation of bovine coronavirus RNA synthesis. Abstract The structure and synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCV)-specific intracellular RNA were studied. A genome-size RNA and seven subgenomic RNAs with molecular weights of approximately 3.3 × 106, 3.1 × 106, 2.6 × 106, 1.1 × 106, 1.0 × 106, 0.8 × 106 and 0.6 × 106 were detected. Comparisons of BCV intracellular RNAs with those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated the presence of an additional RNA for BCV, species 2a, of 3.1 × 106 daltons. BCV RNAs contain a nested-set structure similar to that of other coronaviruses. This nested-set structure would suggest that the new RNA has a capacity to encode a protein of approximately 430 amino acids. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA are differentially regulated. At 4 to 8 h post-infection (p.i.), subgenomic RNAs are synthesized at a maximal rate and represent greater than 90% of the total viral RNA synthesized, whereas genome-size RNA accounts for only 7%. Later in infection, at 70 to 72 h p.i., genome-size RNA is much more abundant and accounts for 88% of total RNA synthesized. Immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-pulse-labeled viral proteins demonstrated that viral protein synthesis occurs early in the infection, concurrent with the peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Western blot analysis suggests that these proteins are stable since the proteins are present at high level as late as 70 to 72 h p.i. The kinetics of production of virus particles coincides with the synthesis of genomic RNA. These studies thus indicate that there is a differential temporal regulation of the synthesis of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs, and that the synthesis of genomic RNA is the rate-limiting step regulating the production of virus particles.',\n 'Nucleotide sequence of coronavirus TGEV genomic RNA: evidence for 3 mRNA species between the peplomer and matrix protein genes. Abstract The region of the TGEV genome between the E1-matrix protein gene and the E2-peplomer protein gene has been sequenced from a cDNA clone. The consensus recognition sequence, 5 ′AA TT CTAAAC was found upstream from 3 large open reading frames. In coronaviruses these homologous recognition sequences are involved in the initiation of transcription suggesting that there are 3 mRNA species in this region of the TGEV genome. Northern blot analysis and nuclease S1 mapping confirmed the presence of 3 mRNA species between mRNA 3 encoding the E2-peplomer protein and mRNA 6 encoding the E1-matrix protein. The 5′ regions of these 3 mRNAs encode potential polypeptides of predicted molecular weight; 7859, 27744 and 9287, respectively. The potential translation product of ORF B (27744 Da) is considerably larger than previously reported and could be difficult to distinguish by size from the E1-matrix protein.',\n \"Detailed structural analysis of a genome rearrangement in bovine rotavirus. Abstract A genome rearrangement involving RNA segment 11 of a bovine rotavirus has been analysed by molecular cloning and sequencing. This revealed that the rearranged genome segment was generated by a head to tail concatemerisation of two almost full length copies of segment 11. The upstream copy of the gene has lost its 3' end and the downstream copy its 5' end. The truncation of the upstream copy of the gene occurs within the termination codon for VP11 converting it from a UAG to a UGA, the rearranged gene is therefore still able to encode a normal VP11. The possible mechanisms by which this rearrangement may have been generated are discussed.\",\n 'Expression of antisense RNA fails to inhibit influenza virus replication. Abstract Cell lines were constructed which permanently express influenza virus-specific RNA. Two approaches were followed. C127 cells were transformed with bovine papilloma virus (BPV) vectors and the resulting cell lines were found to inhibit the replication of influenza virus at low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.05). However, examination of cellular RNA using single-stranded probes revealed the presence of both ( + )sense and antisense RNA transcripts (45–70 copies per cell). In this BPV-based system the inhibitory activity appeared to be associated with a nonspecific, interferon (IFN)-mediated effect. In the second approach, an expression system was used which involved 293 cells, a chimeric human cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, and methotrexate- (Mtx)-mediated gene amplification. Cells were found to express up to 7500 copies of influenza virus-specific RNA per cell at a steady state level. In this system no RNA transcripts of the opposite orientation were found. However, all cell lines permanently expressing either (−)sense or ( + )sense viral RNA failed to reduce influenza virus titers in a multi-cycle replication experiment (MOI 0.01).',\n \"Sequence analysis of nucleocapsid gene and leader RNA of human coronavirus OC43. Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the 3'-end of the genomic RNA of human coronavirus OC43 (HCV-OC43) was determined from the cDNA clones of the intracellular virus-specific mRNAs. The nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the main open reading frame (ORF), which represents the nucleocapsid (N) protein, were highly homologous to those of bovine coronavirus (BCV) Mebus strain. This ORF predicts a protein of 448 amino acids. Additional smaller ORFs are also present in a different reading frame. We have also determined the leader sequence present at the 5'-end of HCV-OC43 mRNAs by a primer extension study. This sequence is highly homologous to that of mouse hepatitis virus, particularly in the 3'-end of the leader sequence, which is postulated to be involved in the unique mechanism of leader-primed transcription. These data suggest that HCV-OC43 and BCV might have diverged from each other fairly recently and that the 3'-end of the leader sequence has significant functional roles.\",\n 'Inhibition of murine coronavirus RNA synthesis by hydroxyguanidine derivatives. Abstract A series of hydroxyguanidine derivatives, which are substituted salicylaldehyde Schiff-bases of 1-amino-3- hydroxyguanidine tosylate, were tested for the inhibition of RNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). It was shown that these compounds could selectively inhibit virus-specific RNA synthesis. Every aspect of viral RNA synthesis, including synthesis of negative-stranded RNA, subgenomic mRNA transcription and genomic RNA replication, was inhibited to roughly the same extent. These compounds are the first known inhibitors of coronaviral RNA synthesis and should prove useful for understanding the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis.',\n 'Comparative features of a coronavirus isolated from a cheetah with feline infectious peritonitis. Abstract A coronavirus which was isolated from a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) that succumbed to feline infectious peritonitis was characterized in vitro. The virus was determined to be highly cell-associated with Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells and was routinely maintained as a persistent infection (CrFK 83–4497). The cheetah coronavirus was compared with other members of the feline coronavirus group including the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) 79–1683 and the feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV), 79–1146, and UCD-1. The cheetah coronavirus was demonstrated to have a restricted host-cell range with limited cytopathic effect. Indirect immunofluorescence with antisera to FIPV UCD-1 revealed the concentration of viral antigens in the perinuclear region of cells infected with the cheetah coronavirus. Ultrastructural studies of the cheetah coronavirus indicated a limited number of immature viral particles within cytoplasmic vesicles and at the cell surface. This was in contrast to electron microscopy results of FECV 79–1683 and FIPV 79–1146, which had numerous mature virus particles within the cytoplasmic vesicles, as well as at the cell surface. The cheetah coronavirus was tentatively placed in the feline coronavirus family based upon its antigenic reactivity by immunofluorescence; however, the possibility that it represents a unique coronavirus of cheetahs should not be dismissed without further analyses at the host and genomic levels.',\n 'Hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus attaches to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-containing receptors on erythrocytes: comparison with bovine coronavirus and influenza C virus. Abstract The receptors for the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV, a porcine coronavirus) on chicken erythrocytes were analyzed and compared to the receptors for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and influenza C virus. Evidence was obtained that HEV requires the presence of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) on the cell surface for agglutination of erythrocytes as has been previously shown for BCV and influenza C virus: (i) Incubation of red blood cells with sialate 9-O-acetylesterase, the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus, rendered the erythrocytes resistant against agglutination by each of the three viruses; (ii) Human erythrocytes which are resistant to agglutination by HEV acquire receptors for HEV after resialylation with Neu5,9Ac2. Sialylation of red blood cells with limiting amounts of sialic acid indicated that strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus requires less Neu5,9Ac2 for agglutination of erythrocytes than the two coronaviruses, both of which were found to be similar in their reactivity with Neu5,9Ac2-containing receptors.',\n 'Expression of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus envelope antigens on the surface of infected cells: epitopes externally exposed. Abstract The peplomer protein (S) and the transmembrane protein (M) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were identified by iodination and serologically on the surface of infected cells. Of a total of 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against four antigenic sites of S protein (Correa et al., 1988), 3 specific for sites A, B and D attached to the plasma membrane of infected cells, as disclosed by indirect immunofluorescence and by complement-mediated cytolysis. Four of the mAbs assayed were specific for the viral protein M and two of them gave plasma membrane immunofluorescence and mediated cytolysis in the presence of complement. The viral nucleoprotein N could not be demonstrated on the surface of infected cells either by iodination or employing 3 mAbs against this protein. Finally, a time course infection experiment demonstrated that S and M proteins were expressed on the surface of infected cells at 4 h after infection, before infective virus was released from infected cells.',\n \"Sequence of the S gene from a virulent British field isolate of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), strain FS772/70, was used to produce cDNA. The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.\",\n 'Localization of major neutralizing epitopes on the S1 polypeptide of the murine coronavirus peplomer glycoprotein. Abstract A recombinant baculovirus system has been used to express the amino terminal half of the murine coronavirus (JHMV) peplomer glycoprotein in insect cells. The expressed polypeptide is glycosylated and is recognized by a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for JHMV S protein. Three of these mAbs have a very high neutralizing activity for JHMV but not for other MHV strains. These results indicate that JHMV-specific, major neutralizing epitopes reside in the amino terminal S1 subunit of the peplomer glycoprotein.',\n 'Expression and cellular localisation of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus N and M proteins by recombinant vaccinia viruses. Abstract Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nucleoprotein and integral membrane protein genes were cloned into the vaccinia virus insertion vector, pGS20, in the correct orientation for expression under the control of the vaccinia P 7.5K promoter. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by in vivo homologous recombination of the insertion vector with the WR strain of vaccinia virus. Nucleoprotein (N) expressed by both recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV had a relative molecular mass (M r) of 47,000 and was susceptible to degradation at the C-terminus yielding discrete breakdown products. The integral membrane protein (M) expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV was sensitive to endogly-cosidase H reducing the mature polypeptide of M r 29,000 to a species of M r 27,000. Expression of M by recombinant vaccinia virus was inhibited during early infection due to a cryptic vaccinia virus transcriptional termination signal within the TGEV coding sequence. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that both N and M were only localised in the cell cytoplasm of either TGEV or recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells. Antisera from mice infected with recombinant viruses immunoprecipitated specific TGEV antigens from lysates of TGEV infected cells but had little significant TGEV neutralising activity in vitro.',\n \"The cloning and sequencing of the virion protein genes from a British isolate of porcine respiratory coronavirus: comparison with transmissible gastroenteritis virus genes. Abstract Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mRNA species showed that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mRNA species (Page et al. (1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes. No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified.\",\n 'Characterization of haemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus expressed by a recombinant baculovirus. Abstract A recombinant baculovirus containing a cDNA which encodes haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was constructed. Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of HN glycoprotein similar to the authentic HN in size. The recombinant HN glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. The antigenic properties of the recombinant HN glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one, as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies, and were completely protected from the NDV challenge.',\n 'Neurovirulence of six different murine coronavirus JHMV variants for rats. Abstract Six variant viruses of the JHMV strain of murine coronavirus with large (cl-2, CNSV, DL and DS) or small (sp-4 and JHM-X) S proteins were compared in terms of their relative neurovirulence in weanling Lewis rats. Inoculation of various doses of the variants revealed that the cl-2 and CNSV were highly virulent and DL and DS were low-virulent, while sp-4 and JHM-X were avirulent. Pathological examination of rats infected with variants cl-2, DL and sp-4 showed that the cl-2 and DL induced severe and mild acute encephalomyelitis, respectively, while no lesions were observed in the central nervous system of rats infected with sp-4. Virus growth and distribution of antigen in rat brains correlated strongly with neurovirulence. These results suggest that S protein plays a role in neurovirulence in rats. In addition, these variant viruses were shown to be useful tools for further analysis of JHMV neurovirulence in animals as well as in cultured cells.',\n 'Carbohydrate-induced conformational changes strongly modulate the antigenicity of coronavirus TGEV glycoproteins S and M. Abstract The carbohydrate composition and the immunoreactivity of the S and M glycoproteins of the coronavirus TGEV were studied at different stages of their maturation. The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30–36K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K. These data led us to conclude that co-translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins.',\n \"Sequence analysis of human coronavirus 229E mRNAs 4 and 5: evidence for polymorphism and homology with myelin basic protein. Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.\",\n 'Assembly of G1 and G2 glycoprotein oligomers in Punta Toro virus-infected cells. Abstract We have studied the oligomerization of the membrane glycoproteins of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae, and the effect of glycosylation on protein stability and transport. By using sucrose gradient centrifugation, the G1 and G2 glycoproteins in PTV-infected or recombint-transfected cells were found to sediment as dimers after DSP cross-linking, suggesting that the G1 and G2 proteins are associated as dimers by non-covalent interactions. Pulse-chase and two-dimensional gel analysis indicate that dimerization occurs between newly synthesized G1 and G2 proteins, and that a small fraction of the G2 proteins is assembled into G2 homodimers. The amounts of G1 and G2 proteins were substantially decreased, while the amounts of nucleocapsid protein remained nearly unchanged, when PTV-infected cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, indicating that the G1 and G2 proteins are unstable if glycosylation is prevented.',\n \"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV): subgenomic mRNAs, mRNA leader and comparison of 3'-terminal sequences of two LDV isolates. Abstract The 3'-terminal 1314 nucleotides of the genome of one isolate of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, LDV-P, has been derived by sequence analyses of cDNAs from several genomic libraries and compared to that of another LDV isolate, LDV-C (Godeny et al. (1990) Virol. 177, 768–771). The 3'-non-coding segment of 80 nucleotides of the two LDV genomes is identical, whereas marked, but varying nucleotide and amino acid divergence is apparent in the three upstream overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The third ORF from the 3'-end exhibits only 82% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identity, whereas the 3'-terminal ORF, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein, exhibits approximately 99% amino acid identity. The second 3'-terminal ORF encodes an 18.8 kDa protein which lacks N-glycosylation sites but possesses 2 or 3 potential transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the molecule. A similar membrane organization is observed for the corresponding protein of equine arteritis virus and the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The sequence analyses combined with Northern hybridization analyses of RNA from LDV-infected macrophages and spleens of LDV-infected mice indicate that the three ORFs encoded by the 3'-terminal end of the LDV genome are expressed via the three smallest mRNAs (mRNAs 6–8) of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV (mRNAs 2–8), which range in size from about 0.8 to 3.6 kb. All mRNAs have been shown to carry poly(A)-tracts and a common leader sequence. The seven mRNAs were produced in infected macrophage cultures concomitantly with genomic LDV RNA. Maximum LDV RNA synthesis was observed between 6 and 8 h post-infection. The same seven subgenomic mRNAs were detected in macrophages infected with three different isolates of LDV, but different relative amounts of some of the mRNAs were produced. The relative proportions of molecules of mRNAs 1–8 present in 6 h LDV-P-infected macrophages were about 13, 5, 5, 8, 6, 11, 11 and 27% of the total, respectively.\",\n 'Comparative analyses of the nucleocapsid genes of several strains of infectious bronchitis virus and other coronaviruses. Abstract The natural sequence variations of the nucleocapsid genes of the Gray, Arkansas99 (Ark99), and Holland52 (Holl52) strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were determined. These were compared with previously published sequencing data of other IBV strains, as well as other coronaviruses, in order to correlate the serological and evolutionary relationship of coronaviruses. IBV nucleotide sequence alignment shows that overall the sequences are highly conserved, with homologies from 91.1 to 96.5%. However, there are also two regions (730 to 800 and 1138 to 1166) that appear to be even more highly conserved. Overall, the nucleocapsid protein is highly variable both in size and composition between coronavirus major antigenic groups but is conserved within these groups. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.',\n 'In vitro translation of a subgenomic mRNA from purified virions of the Spanish field isolate AST/89 of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV). Abstract Purified preparations of the Spanish field isolate of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus AST/89 were found to contain the plus-stranded genomic RNA of more than 7.4 kilobases (kb) and large amounts of a subgenomic mRNA of 2.4 kb. The smaller RNA was translated in vitro and shown to code for a 60 kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated using anti-RHDV as well as anti-VP60 sera.',\n 'A H1 hemagglutinin of a human influenza A virus with a carbohydrate-modulated receptor binding site and an unusual cleavage site. Abstract Two receptor binding variants of the influenza virus A/Tübingen/12/85 (H1N1) were separated by their different plaque formation in MDCK cells. Hemagglutination of variant I was restricted to red blood cells of guinea pigs, whereas variant II also hemagglutinated chicken cells. The variants differed also in their ability to bind to α2,6-linked sialic acid. Evidence is presented that this difference is determined by a complex carbohydrate side chain at asparagine131 near the receptor binding site which is absent in variant II. With both variants, the arginine found at the cleavage site of all other human isolates analyzed so far was replaced by lysine.',\n \"Analysis of a hypervariable region in the 3' non-coding end of the infectious bronchitis virus genome. Abstract Previous studies on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cDNA have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' non-coding terminus of both the U.S. prototype strain (Beaudette) and a Japanese strain (KB8523), that was not present in an antigenically closely related U.S. strain, Massachusetts (Mass) 41 (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988). In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity. However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Ho1152 and Ark99, to 92.8% between Beaudette and Gray. The flanking sequences were not only conserved but these sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR also formed mirrored images.\",\n 'Molecular characterization of the S proteins of two enterotropic murine coronavirus strains. Abstract Enterotropic strains of murine coronaviruses (MHV-Y and MHV-RI) differ extensively in their pathogenesis from the prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses. In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.',\n 'Quantification of individual subgenomic mRNA species during replication of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract A biotinylated-oligonucleotide-based method was used to isolate the subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to investigate the amounts of the mRNAs produced at early, middle and late times in the replication cycle. TGEV mRNA 6, which encodes the N protein, was observed to be the most abundant species throughout the replication cycle. The ratios of mRNA 6 to the other mRNAs were 1:0.11 (mRNA 2), 1:0.16 (mRNAs 3 and 4) and 1:0.37 (mRNA 5) at 12 h post-infection. All the mRNA species were differentially regulated throughout the replication cycle, although the rate of accumulation of mRNAs 4, 5, and 6, but not mRNA 3, increased markedly towards the end of the replication cycle. mRNA 7 was not detected in the system used. There was no observable correlation between the amounts of each mRNA synthesised and the potential degree of base pairing between the 3′ end of the leader sequence and the transcription associated sequences on the genomic RNA at any time during the replication cycle. This indicates that the extent of base pairing was not the only factor involved in the control of subgenomic mRNA synthesis.',\n 'Expression of soluble forms of rubella virus glycoproteins in mammalian cells. Abstract Rubella virus (RV) virions contain two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Removal of hydrophobia regions in their carboxyl termini by genetic engineering caused them to be secreted rather than maintained in cell membranes of transfected COS cells. Truncated E2 was secreted in the absence of E1, whereas E1 lacking its transmembrane domain required coexpression of E2 for export from the cell. Secreted E2 was found to contain both O-linked and N-linked complex glycans, whereas secreted E1 retained virus neutralization and hemagglutination epitopes, suggesting the possibility of using soluble RV antigens as subunit vaccines and for serodiagnostic purposes. Stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines secreting RV E1 were constructed for large scale preparation of recombinant E1.',\n \"Nucleotide sequence comparison of the membrane protein genes of three enterotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus. Abstract The nucleotide sequences of the membrane (M) protein genes and their deduced amino acid sequences of three enterotropic strains of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) -Y, -RI and -DVIM were determined and compared with the previously reported sequences of two respiratory MHV strains -A59 and -JHM. The five MHV strains shared extensive nucleotide (95.2–99.0%) as well as amino acid homology (95.6–98.7%). A variable region, including a 15 nucleotide deletion unique to MHV-RI, could be identified at the 5'-terminus of the gene. This region of the M protein may be immunogenic and may contribute to the antigenic diversity of the MHV strains. Sequence relationships between the strains showed no correspondence with the primary cell tropism. This may suggest that evolution of enterotropism was not a single occurrence among different MHV strains. No sequence unique to either tropism group could be identified, indicating that the M protein of MHV probably has no part in the determination of MHV tissue tropism.\",\n \"Detection of negative-stranded subgenomic RNAs but not of free leader in LDV-infected macrophages. Abstract The mechanism of synthesis of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) was explored. One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5'-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process. Finally, no subgenomic mRNAs were detected in LDV virions.\",\n \"Evolutionary implications of genetic variations in the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) provide a broad genetic background for examining naturally occurring coronavirus variation. Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of S1 genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The hypervariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the S1 gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for recombination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.\",\n 'The membrane glycoprotein G1 of Uukuniemi virus contains a signal for localization to the Golgi complex. Abstract Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.',\n 'Sequence and in vitro expression of the phosphoprotein gene of avian pneumovirus. Abstract The phosphoprotein (P) gene of two subgroup A strains of avian pneumovirus comprised 855 nucleotides containing only one substantial open reading frame encoding a protein of 278 amino acids, with a predicted M r of 30,323. In vitro translation of P mRNA in a wheat germ system resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of M r 35,000 Comparison of the deduced P protein sequence with that of the known mammalian pneumoviruses revealed overall amino acid identities ranging from 31 to 34.5%, suggesting a distant relationship. However, there was a much higher identity (63.2–68.4%) in a region of 57 residues, which included a heptad repeat sequence.',\n 'Cloning and sequencing of a 8.4-kb region from the 3′-end of a Taiwanese virulent isolate of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract The nucleotide sequence (8396 nucleotides) was determined, from the 3′-end of the putative polymerase gene to the poly(A) tail, for a Taiwanese virulent isolate, TFI, of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades. The two extra amino acids found to be present in the spike proteins of the virulent FS772/70 and Miller strains when compared to the avirulent Purdue strain were found to be present in the TFI strain. The genomic organisation of the TFI strain was the same as that of the other TGEV viruses.',\n 'Characterization of monoclonal antibodies recognizing neurotropic Friend murine leukemia virus. Abstract We isolated a replication-competent, neurotropic retrovirus (FrC6 virus) and its molecular clone A8 from the NB-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus (FLV) complex. For detection and characterization of the FrC6 and A8 viruses, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the FLV complex were established. Thirty MAbs, each of which reacted with the FLV-producing cell line, were tested for potential neutralizing activities; only two MAbs inhibited the proliferation of the A8 virus. These two MAbs were ineffective or had very weak neutralizing activities toward the non-neurotropic FLV strain clone 57 virus. Further characterization of MAbs by immunoprecipitation revealed that 4 MAbs recognized the envelope protein of the A8 virus. Two of these 4 MAbs recognized the surface glycoprotein gp70, requiring the conformational epitope of the virus for this recognition, while the other two MAbs, which were reactive with the transmembrane protein p15E, were conformation-independent Both of the MAbs against gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic viruses to some extent, through neutralizing activity or binding activity detected by immunoprecipitation, whereas the two MAbs against p15E reacted with the viruses in a similar manner. Furthermore, one of the MAbs distinguished the viral antigen in the wall of the vacuolation that composes the spongiotic lesion induced by FrC6 viral infection of the brain.',\n 'Detection of related positive-strand RNA virus genomes by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers for common replicase sequences. Abstract A set of degenerate sense and antisense primers were designed on the basis of short segments with identical amino acids in the predicted ORF 1b replicase proteins of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, strain Lelystad virus (PRRSV-LV), which are members of a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF 1b segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF 1b segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF 1b of LDV, EAV and PRRSV. The results show that these and other degenerate primer sets might be useful for the search of related viruses in other mammalian species.',\n 'Expression cloning and antigenic analysis of the nucleocapsid protein of equine arteritis virus. Abstract A series of recombinant fusion proteins derived from equine arteritis virus (EAV) open reading frame (ORF) 7 have been used to define the immunoreactive region of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. Reactivities of recombinant N fusion proteins with post-infection equine sera in immunoblots and ELISAs indicate that the major nucleocapsid protein epitope is located within amino acid residues 1–69. In ELISAs two recombinant nucleocapsid fusion proteins containing residues 1–69 (rN1–69) and 1–28 (rN1–28) discriminated between pre- and post-infection, and pre- and post-vaccination serum samples. Additionally rN1–69 and rN1–28 detected seroconversions following vaccination with a killed virus preparation, even in the absence of a detectable virus neutralising response. Although a good correlation existed between virus neutralising antibody and rN1–69 ELISA positive values in post-infection sera, all the rN proteins failed to induce any virus neutralising response in immunised rabbits.',\n 'A conditional-lethal murine coronavirus mutant that fails to incorporate the spike glycoprotein into assembled virions. Abstract The coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) mediates both the attachment of virus to the host cell receptor and membrane fusion. We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Alb 18), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Alb18 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Alb18 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucine, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.',\n 'Brefeldin A inhibits the antiviral action of interferon against encephalomyocarditis virus. Abstract Brefeldin A (BFA), a unique fungal metabolite of a 13-membered lactone ring, exhibits various biological actions, including antitumor, antifungal and antiviral activities. In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2–5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2–3-fold) in the mRNA of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate (2–5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2–5A synthetase, 2–5A dependent RNase and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2–5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.',\n 'A continuous epitope from transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein fused to E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit expressed by attenuated Salmonella induces serum and secretory immunity. Abstract Antigenic site D from the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a continuous epitope critical in neutralization, has been expressed as a fusion protein with E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LT-B) in attenuated S. typhimurium. Synthetic peptides containing the sequence of site D induced TGEB neutralizing antibodies when inoculated subcutaneously in both rabbits and swine. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding residues 373–398 of TGEV S protein, including antigenic site D, was cloned in frame with the 3′ end of LT-B gene, into a plasmid used to transform S. typhimurium Δasd χ3730. A collection of 6 recombinant plasmids designated pYALTB-D I–VI encoding LTB-site D fusions with a variable number of site D sequences were selected. Four of the 6 LTB-site D fusion products expressed in S. typhimurium χ3730 formed oligomers (pentamers) that dissociated at > 70°. S. typhimurium χ3730 (pYALTB-D) V and VI expressed the oligomer forming products with higher antigenicity. Partially purified LTB-site D fusion product expressed from S. typhimurium χ3730 (pYALTB-D) V induced anti-TGEV neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Recombinant vaccine strain S. typhimurium Δcya ΔcrpΔasd χ 3987 transformed with plasmid pYALTB-D V expressed constitutively products that formed oligomers presumably containing 20 copies of site D, and showed a high stability in vitro. This recombinant strain was orally inoculated in rabbits and induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and intestinal secretion.',\n 'Growth characteristics and protein profiles of prototype and wild-type rat coronavirus isolates grown in a cloned subline of mouse fibroblasts (L2p.176 cells). Abstract Rat coronaviruses (RCVs) infect laboratory rats and confound biomedical research results. In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p.176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p.176 cells were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolats. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.',\n 'Genetic variation in open reading frame 2 of field isolates and laboratory strains of equine arteritis virus. Abstract The open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of three laboratory strains, the live attenuated vaccine virus, and 18 field isolates of equine arteritis virus (EAV) from Europe and North America was sequenced. The ORF2 of EAV encodes the Gs protein that is abundantly expressed in infected cells but constitutes less than 2% of the virion protein mass. Variation of ORF2 among the isolates facilitated phylogenetic analysis that largely confirmed results of an earlier study based on sequence divergence of ORF5 of the same isolates of EAV, despite exposure of the proteins encoded by ORF2 (Gs) and ORF5 (GL) to potentially different selective pressures in vivo. The data indicate that the Gs protein is highly conserved between isolates, considerably more so than the GL protein, consistent with an important role of the Gs protein in virus replication.',\n 'Altered pathogenicity in the liver induced by a mouse hepatitis virus type 3 thermosensitive mutant. Abstract Intraperitoneal inoculation into sensitive BALB/c mice of D85, a thermosensitive (ts) mutant, provokes acute hepatitis followed by recovery of the mice. The ts mutant was able to replicate in the liver. However, the maximal viral titre was obtained 2 days later than was the case with the wild-type (wt) MHV 3 infection; the viral antigens remained localized within small foci and no invasion of the entire liver was observed. The hepatocytes infected with D85 showed strong steatosis similar to that induced by wt virus, but the other lesions induced by MHV 3 (closing of endothelial cell fenestrae and hepatocytolysis) were not seen. An important feature noticed with the D85 mutant concerned the establishment, in the surviving animals, of persistent infection: this phenomenon was demonstrated by the decrease of viral titre in the liver, viral RNA detection, and the fact that viral antigens gradually decreased until the 3rd month post-infection.',\n 'Trans splicing in trypanosomes — archaism or adaptation?. Abstract In trypanosomes, a single transcription unit usually covers several protein-coding genes. The primary transcript is cut up by trans-splicing and polyadenylation machineries to generate individual mature mRNAs. All nuclear mRNAs acquire the same capped 39 nucleotide sequence at their 5′ end as a consequence of the trans-splicing event. Trans splicing is used in the synthesis of some mRNAs in nematodes and chloroplats. These unusual systems are clearly related to cis-splicing systems, but it remains an intriguing question whether they are merely exotic offshoots of cis splicing or archaic remnants of cis-splicing progenitors.',\n 'The polymerase in its labyrinth: mechanisms and implications of RNA recombination. Abstract The wide variety of RNA viruses, and the diseases associated with them, may result in part from the capacity of RNA genomes to evolve through genetic recombination. Here we address the mechanism of RNA recombination, and ask questions about its prevalence and purpose in nature.',\n 'Binding and entry of animal viruses. Abstract Viruses are infectious agents capable of packaging and delivering nucleic acids and proteins to specific populations of cells. To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process. The knowledge of viral tropism, binding and entry suggests strategies which may be applied to the design of targeted therapeutic agents with appropriate specificities and effective delivery mechanisms.',\n 'Design of synthetic peptides for oral vaccination. Abstract The rational design of effective oral vaccines based on synthetic peptides is a very ambitious undertaking, and involves the solution of huge problems related to protection of the antigens against degradation in the alimentary tract, efficient uptake of the antigens by the relevant cells, and efficient induction of long lasting systemic immunity, local immunity, or both. This paper summarises the steps, necessary to develop such synthetic oral vaccines. These steps involve: (1) the definition of B-cell epitopes; (2) the definition of T-cell epitopes; (3) definition of the carrier or backbone molecule; (4) definition of an immunomodulating element; (5) definition of an adjuvant element; and (6) definition of a targeting element. Good progress is being made with respect to the first three steps, the other steps still provide major challenges, notably the definition of targeting elements. Nevertheless, the first synthetic oral vaccines may become reality in the near future, depending on the speed by which new technology in the area of molecular recognition will develop, i.e. the appropriate chemistry, organic chemistry, molecular modelling, resolution of the molecular interaction of key molecules in microbiology and immunology.',\n 'Cell surface proteins of Entamoeba histolytica. Abstract To ask what is new in Entamoeba histolytica research, one need look no further than the surface of this protozoan parasite. In the past year the cloning and partial characterization of five different surface antigens have been reported, a remarkable result of international research efforts against amebiosis. One of these proteins is the first protective immunogen identified in the animal model of amebic liver abscess. Barbara Mann and William Petri review these recent results, propose a nomenclature for the gene family of E. histolytica galactose lectins and discuss the roles of the different surface proteins in adhesion.',\n 'Interactive influence of infectious disease and genetic diversity in natural populations. Abstract The importance of infectious disease in the survival and adaptation of animal populations is rapidly becoming apparent. Throughout evolution, animal species have been continually afflicted with devastating disease outbreaks which have influenced the demographic and genetic status of the populations. Some general population consequences of such epidemics include selection for disease resistance, the occasional alteration of host gene frequencies by a genetic ‘founder effect’ after an outbreak, and genetic adaptation of parasites to abrogate host defense mechanisms. A wide variety of host cellular genes which are polymorphic within species and which confer a regulatory effect on the outcome of infectious diseases has recently been discovered. The critical importance of maintaining genetic diversity with respect to disease defense genes in natural populations is indicated by certain populations which have reduced genetic variability and apparent increased vulnerability to infectious disease.',\n 'A multidisciplinary investigation of a cluster of deaths on a paediatric intensive care unit. Abstract During late December 1989 and early January 1990, a cluster of six unexplained deaths occurred on a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among children with congenital heart disease who had undergone cardiac surgical procedures. The children were all aged three years or less. In each case death was preceded by an unexpected increase in ventilatory pressure requirement followed by the development of a similar pulmonary shadowing on chest radiography. The radiological abnormality was felt to be consistent with a pneumonitis associated with some small airway disease. The clustering of these deaths, occurring in a similar unusual manner, was felt to constitute an outbreak warranting investigation. An Incident Committee was established to plan and manage a large multidisciplinary investigation during which the unit was temporarily closed. Following extensive investigation no bacterium, virus, fungus or other pathogen, toxic agent, or any other explanation for the cluster of deaths could be found. The possibility that the cluster occurred by chance remains although this was felt to be unlikely.',\n 'In-hospital evaluation of orthophthalaldehyde as a high level disinfectant for flexible endoscopes. Abstract One hundred endoscopes used for bronchoscopy (30), gastroscopy (35) or colonoscopy (35) were studied to determine the efficiency of a new high level disinfectant, orthophthalaldehyde (OPA). Manual cleaning was the method studied since this would be the least effective and thereby provide the greatest challenge to the 0·5% ( w v ) OPA solution. The OPA was convenient and easy to use since it did not have irritating vapours and as it is used directly, does not require dilution. Our study demonstrated that the OPA was stable for up to 14 days despite repeated re-use. The cleaning/ disinfection procedure could achieve a ⩾5 LOG10 reduction in bacterial load. This in-hospital evaluation supports the conclusion that OPA is an effective choice as a high level disinfectant for flexible endoscopes.',\n 'Topical pharmacotherapy for allergic rhinitis: Nedocromil. Abstract Nedocromil sodium is a mast-cell stabilizer that prevents or ablates both the acute and late phases of the allergic response. It is an antiinflammatory agent that is not a steroid. It is more potent than the currently available mastcell stabilizer, cromolyn, and maintenance therapy may be possible at less frequent intervals than the initially recommended regimen of 4 times daily. Nedocromil for pulmonary administration is currently available. The nasal form has undergone clinical trials but has not yet been released in the United States.',\n \"Diarrheal disease and DRGs. Abstract This article has presented a rational protocol for examining stools for enteric pathogens. When modified according to a laboratory's geographical location and patient population, this approach should allow efficient, comprehensive diagnosis of diarrheal disease. Laboratories should be able to examine stools routinely for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Y. enterocolitica, intestinal parasites [including Cryptosporidium (14)], rotavirus, and C. difficile toxin. When unusual organisms such as pathogenic E. coli are suspected, or tissue culture facilities for C. difficile toxin assays are unavailable, the use of reference laboratories is strongly encouraged.\",\n 'Endogenous opiates: 1993. Abstract This paper is the sixteenth installment of our annual review of research concerning the opiate system. It is restricted to papers published during 1993 that concern the behavioral effects of the endogenous opiate peptides, and does not include papers dealing only with their analgesic properties. The specific topics this year include stress; tolerance and dependence; eating; drinking; gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic function; mental illness and mood; learning, memory, and reward; cardiovascular responses; respiration and thermoregulation; seizures and other neurological disorders; electrical-related activity; general activity and locomotion; development; immunological responses; and other behaviors.',\n 'The asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylcholine in rat brain synaptic plasma membranes. Abstract The distribution of phosphatidylcholine between inner and outer monolayers of rat brain synaptic plasma membrane was investigated by means of a phosphatidylcholine specific exchange protein. About 70% of the total membranal phosphatidylcholine was in the outer leaflet, 33% of which was exposed and readily exchanged in intact synaptosomes while the remainder was exchangeable following osmotic shock. Permeabilization of the synaptic plasma membranes by overnight incubation in buffer or by saponin (<0.08%) exposed an additional 30% of phosphatidylcholine to exchange, presumably from the inner cytoplasmic leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine is therefore asymmetrically distributed in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, as it is in other plasma membranes.',\n 'Aging-related morphological changes in the main olfactory bulb of the fischer 344 rat. Abstract —Aging-related changes in several structural characteristics of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) were evaluated using Fischer 344 rats 3, 18, 30 or 36 months of age. Histological examination of the nasal mucosa revealed no evidence of concurrent rhinitis in any of the animals studied. The internal granular layer of the MOB exhibited continual growth, increasing in volume by a factor of 63% over the range of ages studied. The sizes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, expressed either as observed cross-sectional areas or as estimated mean volumes, did not change significantly as a function of age. The numbers of mitral cells exhibiting 2 nucleoli in the plane of section decreased from about 22% in the youngest animals to about 4% in the 18- and 30-month old animals and to nil in the oldest animals. These results are discussed in relation to findings of other investigators using Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats. It is concluded that major structural age changes in the rat MOB are strain dependent.',\n 'Necessity of a more standardized virological characterization of rodents for aging studies. Abstract Characterization of the microbiological status is an important facet of a quality assurance program for laboratory animals. This paper addresses basic issues with regard to standardization of the characterization of murine viral status. Methods for such characterization include clinical signs, virus isolation, and serological tests. Significant considerations are screening profiles; sample collection, processing, and s shipment; and sampling schedules. International standardization of programs and methods to control and characterize the microbiological status of laboratory animals is being developed, and will be highly significant in future efforts to produce, control, and maintain laboratory animals free of viral infections.',\n 'Viral antibody titers, immunogenetic markers, and their interrelations in multiple sclerosis patients and controls. Abstract Our purpose was to investigate possible interrelations between antibody titers against seven viruses (measles, rubella, herpes simplex, mumps, varicella-zoster, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus), HLA-class II antigens, and immunoglobulin Gm allotypes in multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQw1 and also an excess of Gm (3; ±23; 5*). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies. Analysis suggests that an association between HLA-DQwl and antibody titers against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody titers were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher titers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls. These findings suggest that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients.',\n 'Analysis of overlapping T- and B-Cell antigenic sites on rubella virus E1 envelope protein influence of HLA-DR4 polymorphism on T-cell clonal recognition. Abstract A CTL antigenic site located between residues 273 and 291 of the E1 envelope protein of RV was identified by 51Cr-release assays employing SPs. Two E1-specific CTL clones were examined for immune recognition of RV wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains and recombinant E1 protein. The exact sequence (273–284) recognized by both clones was delineated by using truncated and overlapping SPs covering these residues. The defined T-cell site overlapped almost completely with a virus neutralizing antibody-binding site previously identified with mouse monoclonal and human antibodies. A series of single aa-substituted SP analogues of E1(273–284) was used to define residues critical for T-cell recognition. Using EBV-Bl displaying different HLA-DR haplotypes and -DR4 subtypes as targets to determine MHC class II restriction elements, immune recognition by both T-cell clones was shown to be associated with HLA-DR4. Three HLA-DR4 subtypes (DR4Dw 13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2) sharing a common residue, glutamic acid at position 74 in their β 1 chains, were able to present SP E1(273–284) to the T-cell clones.',\n 'Viral and bacterial vectors of immunogenes. Abstract A recent development in the production of experimental vaccines has been the use of the smallpox vaccine virus (vaccinia virus) as a carrier (vector) of the genes (immunogenes) which code for the protection-inducing proteins (immunogens) of unrelated viruses. The potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper, safer and/or more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogens. Vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because: (a) several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity; (b) the immunogens appear to be produced normally; (c) vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox; and (d) it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application. Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized first. Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people. When the immunogens of these organisms have been identified there will be added impetus to investigate the potential of vector vaccines against these pathogens.',\n 'Early interactions between animal viruses and the host cell: relevance to viral vaccines. Abstract Viral recognition of specific receptors in the host cell plasma membrane is the first step in virus infection. Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage. Recent advances in the understanding of these processes are reviewed and their relevance to the development of new strategies for vaccines emphasised.',\n 'Vaccines for respiratory disease in cattle. Abstract Respiratory disease is one of the most serious disease complexes affecting beef cattle production. For example, it is claimed to cost the UK industry about £70 million per year. It is usually associated with young cattle and can occur in a variety of situations. It is a good example of multifactorial disease in that its aetiology involves both infection by a variety of microorganisms and a number of environmental factors. Several distinct syndromes occur and a number of microorganisms are thought to be important including the bacteria Pasteurella haemolytica type A1, P. multocida, Haemophilus somnus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma bovis and M. dispar. Of the viruses, bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are known to be important, the former also causing the specific syndrome, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) in addition to its involvement in the pneumonia complex. Other viruses of possible importance include para-influenza 3 (Pi3), adenoviruses, bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus, coronavirus and rhinovirus.',\n 'Effect of diethylcarbamazine on serum antibodies to feline infectious peritonitis in cats. Abstract In preceding studies by the author, use of the immunomodulator drug diethylcarbamazine resulted in the detection of antibodies to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen in nine feline leukaemia virus infected cats that had previously given negative results to this antibody. In the present report, seven diethylcarbamazine-treated cats developed higher serum antibody titres to feline infectious peritonitis more frequently than did seven untreated controls. Since feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus, these results suggest that diethylcarbamazine treatment could be exploited for vaccination and treatment strategies for non-retroviral in addition to retroviral infections.',\n 'Efficacy of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine in the control of calf diarrhoea in beef herds in Argentina. Abstract We have assessed the potency of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine in beef herds in Argentina. Two different vaccine trials were conducted. In a small-scale experimental trial, involving 21 pregnant cows (13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls), a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of unvaccinated controls. Seven days after birth, half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge. Although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals, a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls, particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned. Secondly, a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows. In 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations. In the other six herds, control groups were used to compare data of the same year: 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls. Taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested. Vaccine effectiveness was also evident in farms where other enteropathogens such as cryptosporidium and coronaviruses were present, together with rotavirus.',\n 'Protection against feline infectious peritonitis by intranasal inoculation of a temperature-sensitive FIPV vaccine. Abstract Cats vaccinated intranasally (i.n.) with a temperature sensitive feline infectious peritonitis virus (ts-FIPV) vaccine were protected against an FIP-inducing challenge. Seventeen of 20 vaccinated cats (85%) survived a rigorous virulent FIPV challenge that caused FIP in 12 of 12 non-vaccinated cats (100%), 10 (83%) of which died. Intranasal vaccination stimulated serum IgG and serum and salivary IgA antibody responses (measured by ELISA), FIPV-neutralizing antibody (VN), and a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response as measured by lymphocyte proliferation. The serum antibody response to vaccination was not associated with protection. In fact, the IgG, IgA and VN titres were much higher in control cats than in vaccinated cats following challenge suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In contrast, stimulation of a mucosal IgA response to vaccination was related to protection. The in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to virulent FIPV was observed in vaccinated cats, in vaccinated and challenged cats but not in non-vaccinated challenged cats.',\n 'Sequence evidence for RNA recombination in field isolates of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Abstract Under laboratory conditions coronaviruses were shown to have a high frequency of recombination. In The Netherlands, vaccination against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is performed with vaccines that contain several life-attenuated virus strains. These highly effective vaccines may create ideal conditions for recombination, and could therefore be dangerous in the long term. This paper addresses the question of the frequency of recombination of avian coronavirus IBV in the field. A method was sought to detect and quantify recombination from sequence data. Nucleotide sequences of eight IBV isolates in a region of the genome suspected to contain recombination, were aligned and compared. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for different sections of this region. Differences in topology between these trees were observed, suggesting that in three out of eight strains in vivo RNA recombinant had occurred.',\n 'Induction of anti-viral immune responses by immunization with recombinant-DNA encoded avian coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Abstract Immune responses to the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein were studied using a recombinant-DNA expression product. In mice, a lymphocyte proliferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to IBV were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein. Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsid protein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres. Finally, an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV was observed. These results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken.',\n 'Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections in farm animals. Abstract Fimbrial vaccines are routinely given parenterally to pregnant cattle, sheep and swine to protect suckling newborn calves, lambs and pigs against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections. Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.',\n 'Intestinal protection against challenge with transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs immune after infection with the porcine respiratory coronavirus. Abstract An infection of pigs with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induces antibodies which neutralize the enteropathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV to the same titre. In the present study, 10-week-old seronegative pigs (n = 8), pigs immune following TGEV inoculation (n = 4) or pigs immune following aerosol (n = 8) or intragastric inoculation (n = 4) with PRCV were challenged with TGEV. Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0–4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5–6 days).',\n 'Involvement of the complement system in the protection of mice from challenge with respiratory syncytial virus Long strain following passive immunization with monoclonal antibody 18A2B2. Abstract Passive immunization of mice with 131 μg of the non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18A2B2, directed against the A subgroup epitope of the G glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus Long strain (RSV), confers protection against viral i.n. challenge. The role of the Fc fragment of this antibody as well as the involvement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytolysis towards protection was evaluated in vivo. Passive immunization with the Fab fragment alone (618–907 μg mouse−1) was unable to confer protection in mice. Furthermore, we passively immunized with the mAb 18A2B2 SCID beige mice, which are deficient in natural killer (NK) cell activity, to ascertain the role of NK cells in the protective mechanism. These mice were free of virus 5 days following viral challenge, indicating that NK cells do not contribute significantly towards the protective action of this antibody. Moreover, passively immunized BALB c mice decomplemented with 8–10 U of cobra venom factor (CoVF) and DBA 2J mice (C5 deficient) were only partially protected. These findings suggest that in mice the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system are involved in the passive protection mechanism conferred by the non-neutralizing mAb 18A2B2. To our knowledge, it is the first description of a protective mechanism in mice that involves a non-neutralizing antibody and the complement system.',\n 'Stimulation of rotavirus IgA, IgG and neutralising antibodies in baboon milk by parenteral vaccination. Abstract A rhesus rotavirus vaccine adjuvanted with ISCOMs was injected intramuscularly to 5 pregnant baboons, with repeated doses 1–2 and 14 weeks after delivery. Maternal blood and milk samples and blood samples from their babies were collected at 2-weekly intervals until 26 weeks after parturition. Samples were assayed for rotavirus antibodies by ELISAs and neutralisation tests. Vaccination produced statistically significant increases in maternal serum IgG and neutralising antibodies, and in milk IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibodies. Control baboon mothers sampled from 12 weeks after delivery had lower serum and milk antibody titres, but responded to vaccination at 16 weeks by producing a similar antibody profile in serum and milk to those previously vaccinated. Because of the endemic nature of human rotaviral infections, similar maternal vaccinations have potential as a means of increasing milk antibodies to a level at which they may be protective to infants.',\n 'The significance of aminopeptidases and haematopoietic cell differentiation. Abstract Aminopeptidases are a group of enzymes found on the cell surface and in the cytoplasmic compartments of many peripheral blood cell types and their progenitors. Their functional roles include the hydrolysis of several biologically active peptides and growth factors and some have proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value in leukaemia. These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood. In this report the current literature has been reviewed for evidence of expression, regulation and clinical significance.',\n 'Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection provokes a decrease in the number of sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestrae both in vivo and in vitro. Abstract Fenestrations of hepatic endothelial cells play an active role as a sieving barrier allowing extensive exchange between the blood and liver parenchyma. Alteration of these structures may be induced in the course of various pathological events and provoke important perturbations of liver function. We demonstrate here that sinusoidal endothelial cells are permissive for mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in vivo and in vitro and that this infection leads to a striking decrease in the number of fenestrae. The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network. The decrease in the porosity seems to be related directly to the productive infection of the endothelial cells, because it was not observed in A/J mice resistant to the virus and in susceptible BALB/c mice immunized with a thermosensitive mutant in which no viral replication occurs. In conclusion, a viral infection of liver endothelial cells may cause extensive loss of the fenestrations and thus lead to important functional pertubations.',\n 'Methylene chloride: A two-year inhalation toxicity and oncogenicity study in rats and hamsters. Abstract A long-term study was conducted to determine the possible chronic toxicity and oncogenicity of methylene chloride. Rats and hamsters were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 hr per day, 5 days a week, for 2 years. No exposure-related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Females rats exposed to 3500 ppm had an increased mortality rate while female hamsters exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had decreased mortality rates. Carboxyhemoglobin values were elevated in rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm with the percentage increase in hamsters greater than in rats. Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. While the number of female rats with a benign tumor was not increased, the total number of benign mammary tumors was increased in female rats in an exposure-related manner. This effect was also evident in male rats in the 1500- and 3500-ppm exposure groups. Finally, male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sercomas in the ventral neck region located in or around the salivary glands. Therefore, in this 2-year study, some effects were observed in male and female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride. In contrast, hamsters exposed to the same exposure concentrations had less extensive spontaneous geriatric changes, decreased mortality (females), and lacked evidence of definite target organ toxicity.',\n 'Ninety-day inhalation study in rats, comparing smoke from cigarettes that heat tobacco with those that burn tobacco. Abstract Eight groups of 30 male and 30 female rats were exposed 1 hr per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks, to smoke from reference (tobacco burned) or test (tobacco only heated) cigarettes, at nicotine concentrations of 5, 15, or 30 μg/liter of air. Similar smoke concentrations of wet total particulate matter and carbon monoxide were produced in each of the test/reference comparisons. There was a pronounced depression of minute ventilation of animals in the reference groups, but not in the test animals. Blood carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were similar in animals exposed to smoke from test and reference cigarettes. Plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in the test groups were higher than in the reference groups. There were no differences between the smoke-exposed groups in terms of body weight or feed consumption. At necropsy, an increase in heart weight was noted in both high exposure groups. There were notable differences in histopathology, with fewer and less-pronounced changes in the test groups than in the reference groups. Many of the histopathological responses induced in the reference groups were absent in the test groups. Overall, the study demonstrated a substantial reduction in the biological activity of smoke from the test cigarette when compared with the reference.',\n 'Effect of inhaled azodicarbonamide on F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice with 2-week and 13-week inhalation exposures. Abstract Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensitization and dermatitis in people. Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents.',\n 'Refinement of long-term toxicity and carcinogenesis studies. Abstract The chance that alternatives will completely replace animals for toxicology research in the foreseeable future is nil. Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.',\n 'Response of rat tracheal epithelium to ozone and oxygen exposure in vitro. Abstract Although ozone-induced epithelial injury in vivo has been morphologically characterized, effects of gaseous oxidants on respiratory epithelium in organ culture, where tissue organization is maintained but systemic influences are eliminated, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxygen and ozone results in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than occurs with ozone in air. Tracheal organ cultures were exposed to filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide; filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone; 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide; or 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone for 96 hr. Light- and quantitative electron-microscopic evaluation showed that epithelia to 1 ppm ozone in air exhibited loss of ciliated cells and ciliated cell damage. The epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide were pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, and hyperplastic. Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells, and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present. We conclude that there was a synergism between oxygen and ozone exposure leading to enhanced epithelial injury and metaplasia.',\n 'Reproduction, growth, and development of rats during chronic exposure to multiple field strengths of 60-Hz electric fields. Abstract A study with multiple exposure groups and large group sizes was performed to establish whether exposure to 60-Hz electric fields would result in reproductive and developmental toxicity. A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F1 females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all liver fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F1 females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodacryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodacryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.',\n 'Two-week, repeated inhalation exposure of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ferrocene. Abstract Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron; CAS No. 102-54-5) is a relatively volatile, organometallic compound used as a chemical intermediate, a catalyst, and as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had ∼ 10 times higher “ferrocene hydroxylating” activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes.',\n 'Fourteen-day inhalation study in rats, using aged and diluted sidestream smoke from a reference cigarette I. Inhalation toxicology and histopathology. Abstract Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 6 hr per day for 14 consecutive days to aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS), used as a surrogate for Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), at concentrations of 0.1 (typical), 1 (extreme), or 10 (exaggerated) mg of particulates per cubic meter. Animals were exposed nose-only, inside whole-body chambers, to ADSS from the 1R4F reference cigarette. End-points included histopathology, CO-oximetry, plasma nicotine and cotinine, clinical pathology, and organ and body weights. The only pathological response observed was slight to mild epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity, in the high-exposure group only. No effects were noted at medium or low exposures. The minimal changes noted were reversible, using a subgroup of animals kept without further treatment for an additional 14 days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical or even 10-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle concentrations 100 times higher than typical real-world concentrations).',\n 'Infectious diseases in child day care facilities. Abstract Infections in children in day care are common, but can be limited by education of providers and staff in standards of hygiene, maintenance of basic techniques of infection control, appropriate use of the physical facilities of the day care unit, and maintenance of recommended levels of children and staff.',\n 'Three-generation toxicity study of rats ingesting Brown HT in the diet. Abstract Brown HT was fed to rats of both sexes over three generations at dietary concentrations designed to provide daily intakes of 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day. During the study a number of females died or failed to nurse their litters. This was so severe following the first mating of F1 adults that the animals were remated to provide the next generation. None of these effects were related to treatment. Body weight and food and water intakes were not adversely affected by treatment. No effects of treatment were seen on reproductive performance or foetal and pup development, apart from slight evidence of a treatment-related retarded ossification of the third sternebrae. Organ weights at autopsy showed two changes, one of which was increased kidney weights which, although not present in every generation, seemed to be related to treatment. The other, increased caecum weights, occurred in adult high-dose females of early generations, but not in males or later generations of the study. Apart from brown coloration of tissues, macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed no treatment-related changes. It was concluded that the no-untoward-effect level in the present study was 250 mg Brown HT/kg/day.',\n 'Evaluation of the genotoxicity potential and chronic inhalation toxicity of 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141 b). Abstract A battery of in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted on HCFC-141b as a vapour. Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000 ppm after 17 wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.',\n 'Enteric coronavirus TGEV: partial sequence of the genomic RNA, its organization and expression. Abstract The sequence of the 3′-most 8300 nucleotides of the genome RNA of the Purdue-115 strain of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV, a porcine coronavirus, was determined from cDNA clones. The available sequence corresponds to the part of the genome (total length > 20 kb) expressed through subgenomic mRNAs. The 5 subgenomic and the genomic RNA species detected in TGEV-infected cells form a 3′-coterminal ‘nested’ structure, a unique feature of Coronaviridae. The transcription initiation site of the TGEV subgenomic RNAs appears to involve the hexameric sequence 5′CTAAAC, which is present upstream from each coding region. In addition to the previously identified genes encoding the three structural proteins, E2, E1 and N, two regions, X1 and X2, corresponding to the non-overlapping portion of mRNAs 4 and 3, may code for so far unidentified non-structural polypeptides. The predicted X1 polypeptide (9.2 kDa) is highly hydrophobic. The sequence of the X2 region allows the translation of two non-ovelapping products, i.e., X2a (7.7 kDa).and x2b (18.8 kDa). No RNA species liable to express the extreme 3′ open reading frame X3 was found.',\n 'Dissecting glycoprotein biosynthesis by the use of specific inhibitors. Abstract It is possible to interfere with different steps in the dolichol pathway of protein glycosylation and in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.',\n 'Recognition of correct reading frame by the ribosome. Abstract The translation frame-monitoring mechanism has been suggested earlier, based on transient complementary contacts, between mRNA and rRNA. Recent studies related to the frame-monitoring mechanism are reviewed. The mechanism is well supported by both new experimental and sequence analysis data. Experiments are suggested for further elucidation of the structural details of the mRNA-rRNA interaction in the ribosome.',\n 'The TYMV tRNA-like structure. Abstract The genomic RNA from turnip yellow mosaic virus presents a 3′-end functionally and structurally related to tRNAs. This report summarizes our knowledge about the peculiar structure of the tRNA-like domain and its interaction with tRNA specific proteins, like RNAse P, tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and elongation factors. It discusses also the biological role of this structure in the viral life cycle. A brief survey of our knowledge of other tRNA mimicries in biological systems, as well as their relevance for understanding canonical tRNA, will also be presented.',\n 'Identification of a sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway at the N-terminus of pro-opiomelanocortin. Abstract The N-terminal 26 amino acids of the prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were investigated to determine whether this region has the capacity to act as a sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway. Constructs were made using the N-terminal 101, 50, 26 or 10 amino acids of POMC fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter protein and expressed in AtT20 cells to show that at least the first 26 amino acids were required to sort CAT to the regulated secretory pathway. Full length POMC was mutated by deleting amino acids 2–26 from the N-terminal region. Analysis of Neuro-2a cells expressing this mutation compared to wild type POMC indicated that these 26 amino acids contain information essential for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway. The results presented here suggest the presence of a conformation-dependent signal in the N-terminal 26 amino acids of POMC responsible for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway.',\n 'Determinants of translational fidelity and efficiency in vertebrate mRNAs. Abstract This article reviews current knowledge on the mechanisms affecting the fidelity of initiation codon selection, and discusses the effects of structural features in the 5′-non-coding region on the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA molecules.',\n 'Problems of calf rearing in connection with their mortality and optimal growth: A review. Abstract Protection of calves against enteric and respiratory disorders is dependent on the passive immunity that the calf has received, its innate resistance to infection, the burden of infection in the environment and the nutrition of the calf. Superimposed on these, are the effects of management and physical environment. The plane of nutrition required for dairy heifers during rearing depends on the age at first calving, and for meat animals depends on the carcass weight and fat deposition required at a particular slaughter date in relation to time of birth.',\n 'Application of monoclonal antibodies in animal production: A review. Abstract The hybridoma technology for production of monoclonal antibodies circumvents many of the constraints associated with the use of conventional antisera, and consequently broadens the areas of application of antibodies in animal sciences. In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production - with emphasis on reproduction - is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.',\n 'An attempt at measuring health in nucleus and multiplier pig farms. Abstract A pilot epidemiological inquiry was undertaken in France in a group of 205 nucleus and multiplier pig farms. The aim was to find out a method for a quantitative evaluation of the health level in farms selling young breeders. An exhaustive protocol was prepared for data collection. The sources of information were clinical inspections on the farms, meat inspection data at slaughter and laboratory investigations. Data processing issued in the selection of a profile made of 14 prevailing health indicators. These were then associated so as to set up a health index with an overall score. In a second phase, the relevance of the method with respect to disease transmission was assessed. The principle was a contact challenge within totally controlled facilities between SPF pigs hysterectomy-derived and gilts taken from farms with different health scores as previously checked. The contact lasted for 28 days. Eleven farms were chosen and in every one of them 7 gilts were sampled and 10 SPF pigs were assigned to each of these farms. All the pigs were submitted to a detailed observation. At the end of it the pigs were euthanized at the laboratory and checked to find out any lesions and infectious agents. A wide range of symptoms appeared among the SPF pigs. Mortality rate was 14.6%. Pneumonia affected 23.7% of them. A relationship was found between the germ transfer and the severity of the troubles. The degree of illness in SPF pigs was clearly related to the score obtained previously in the corresponding farms. Consequently, the method was considered as valid with respect to health evaluation.',\n 'Basic aspects of immunomodulation through active immunization. Abstract This paper reviews how immunomodulation through active vaccination has evolved in the past 25 years. Although initially it progressed isolated from the main stream of immunological research and vaccine development, lately it merged with this main stream and is taking full advantage of the newest developments in vaccinology. The first immunomodulation vaccine is already on the market, while various others are close to it. Not in the least because one of the major stumbling blocks of immunomodulation through active vaccination, the inherent low immunogenicity of ‘self’ antigens, has in a number of other cases been solved. Most progress has been made in veterinary applications and has helped to formulate practical rules, necessary to break immunotolerance. It is not unlikely that these rules will be used to design better immunomodulation vaccines to be used in humans; notably to control fertility or combat tumours.',\n 'Reduction of tumor necrosis factor production by splenocytes from v-Ha-ras oncogene-bearing mice. Abstract Mice containing the activated v-Ha-ras oncogene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer produced less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than genetically identical animals without it. Inbred Oncomice containing the v-Ha-ras oncogene and inbred FVB mice without it were grown for 6 months. Splenocytes were isolated and stimulated in vitro to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and γ-interferon (IFN). TNF production by cells from Oncomice was significantly decreased compared to cells from FBV mice. There was a tendency for decrease, but no significant difference was seen on IFN release. These observations suggest that the oncogene may play a role in the immune system.',\n 'Porcine coccidia in Papua New Guinea. Abstract Faecal samples from 232 domestic pigs raised on concrete, 98 free-ranging village pigs, and five wild boar showed 46.6 ( 108 232 ), 54 ( 53 98 ) and 80% ( 4 5 ) prevalence of coccidian oocysts, respectively. Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%). The first five species listed above predominated in the village pigs as well. E. polita, E. spinosa and I. suis were not found in the wild boar. I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% ( 3 27 ) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 <24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones. One of the most interesting findings in the study was that the sows were more frequently infected than all other age groups.',\n 'Diagnosis of bovine cryptosporidiosis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Abstract This paper describes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. A monoclonal antibody with a high affinity against an oocyst antigen was used to set up the test. The efficiency of this assay was compared with that of the flotation test; 275 calf faecal samples were examined by the two methods. There was 96% agreement between the two tests. For the 11 conflicting samples, the two tests were repeated and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on faecal smears. All these 11 samples contained few oocysts, but only five and six of them were shown to be positive by the ELISA and flotation tests, respectively. The degree of sensitivity of the ELISA and flotation tests is comparable; samples heavily or moderately contaminated with oocysts are detected by both methods. This ELISA is reliable and never gives rise to false positive results. Nevertheless, as with the flotation test, the occasional case containing very few oocysts will not always be detected by this test. If necessary, very accurate diagnosis can be made by a staining technique or by a direct immunofluorescent assay. In veterinary medicine, the ELISA seems to be a method of choice; it appears to be a fast and reliable technique which could be used as a routine test for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nevertheless the degree of sensitivity must always be borne in mind. There is no need for a microscopic examination, which is an additional advantage.',\n 'The effect of halofuginone lactate on experimental Cryptosporidium parvum infections in calves. Abstract The chemoprophylactic effects of halofuginone lactate were tested against calf experimental cryptosporidiosis. Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 × 106 oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1, respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D) 2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from D0 to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 μg kg−1 day−1) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality (3 out of 5). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1 doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.',\n 'Diagnosis of Cryptosporidium on a sheep farm with neonatal diarrhea by immunofluorescence assays. Abstract An outbreak of diarrhea in neonatal lambs occurred on a a sheep farm in northern Ohio. Diarrhea commenced as early as 1 week of age and lasted for about 3–4 days. Although 100% of the newborn lambs were affected, most had recovered by 3 weeks of age. Cryptosporidium infection appeared to be the cause of diarrhea. Fecal examination of nine diarrheic newborn lambs (5–10 days old), 23 older lambs (2–3 weeks old, six with diarrhea) and 23 clinically normal ewes by immunofluorescence assays revealed infection rates of 100%, 78.3% and 17.4%, respectively. Most newborn lambs had high oocyst counts. Ewes were considered to be an important source of infection for lambs.',\n 'Effects of cattle tick (Boophilus microplus) infestation on the bovine immune system. Abstract The immunosuppressive effect of experimental Boophilus microplus infestation on bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on host antibody production to a protein antigen (ovalbumin) was examined. Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 μl ml−1) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization. The immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation may play an important role in tick survival or in the transmission of tick-borne diseases in the field.',\n 'Concurrent infections of Giardia and Cryptosporidium on two Ohio farms with calf diarrhea. Abstract Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections were diagnosed by immunofluorescence assay on two Ohio dairy farms with calf diarrhea problems. On the first farm, all nine diarrheic calves sampled once in June had Giardia cysts in their feces. On the second farm, all five diarrheic calves examined at the beginning of the diarrhea outbreak in March had Giardia infection. When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (<30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11–22 days old, three were 164–177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection. Five diarrheic calves on the northern Ohio farm and one diarrheic calf on the central Ohio farm were treated with metronidazole after failing to respond to antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed in all calves within 48 h after the start of treatment. The high Giardia infection rates and intensities in calves of a wide age range and the clinical response to metronidazole suggest that Giardia infection contributed to the outbreaks of diarrhea.',\n 'Alteration of intracellular traffic by monensin; mechanism, specificity and relationship to toxicity. Abstract Monensin, a monovalent ion-selective ionophore, facilitates the transmembrane exchange of principally sodium ions for protons. The outer surface of the ionophore-ion comples is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes in nonpolar solvents. In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biological membranes, and its ionophoric expression, is highly dependent on the biochemical configuration of the membrane itself. One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgi apparatus cisternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions. Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species. The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked cisternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensin concentrations or short exposure times, near the middle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensin are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; i.e., changes in Golgi apparatus may be observed after only 2–5 min of exposure. It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations is accompanied by a concomitant efflux of H+ and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of cisternae observed in electron micrographs. In the Golgi apparatus, late processing events such as terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavages are most susceptible to inhibition by monensin. Yet, many incompletely processed molecules may still be secreted via yet poorly understood mechanisms that appear to bypass the Golgi apparatus. In endocytosis, monensin does not prevent internalization. However, intracellular degradation of internalized ligands may be prevented. It is becoming clear that endocytosis involves both acidic and non-acidic compartments and that monensin inhibits those processes that normally occur in acidic compartments. Thus, monensin, which is capable of collapsing Na+ and H+ gradients, has gained wide-spread acceptance as a tool for studying Golgi apparatus function and for localizing and identifying the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic involving acid compartments. Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (0.01–1.0 μM), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensin for Na+ is ten times that for K+, its nearest competitor, monensin mediates primarily a Na+-H+ exchange. Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium. Not only is monensin of importance as an experimental tool, it is of great commercial value as a coccidiostat for poultry and to promote more efficient utilization of feed in cattle. The mechanisms by which monensin interact with coccidia and rumen microflora to achieved these benefits are reasonably well documented. However, the interactions between monensin and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning are well known. Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensin poisoning, and a common effect of monensin poisoning is vacuolization and/or swelling of mitochondria in striated muscle. Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, liver and kidney also have been noted. A consistent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuolization. Differences in cellular response resulting from exposure to monensin (i.e., Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs.mitochondrial swelling in animals fed monensin) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensin metabolite or is a secondary response to some other derivation. However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26], the underlying mode of action of ionophores is on transmembrane ion fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients. Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects in vivo in animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.',\n 'Behavioural deficits and serotonin depletion in adult rats after transient infant nasal viral infection. Abstract Dysfunction of subcortical serotoninergic neurons has been implicated in some behaviour disturbances. The serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe project widely in the brain. They innervate the olfactory bulbs and can be targets for exogenous agents attacking the olfactory epithelium and bulbs. We report here an injury to the serotoninergic neurons after intranasal infection in 12-day-old rats with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus. The brain infection was focal and transient. Viral antigens could no longer be detected 13–15 days after infection. In spite of this the animals, as adults, had a severe serotonin depletion in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and showed abnormal locomotor and explorative behaviour as well as learning deficits. The neocortex was histologically intact and parameters related to other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA and acetylcholine showed no marked changes. A relatively selective damage to serotoninergic nuclei as a result of virus neuroinvasion through a natural portal of entry, may constitute a new pathogenetic mechanism for cortical dysfunction and behavioural deficits.',\n 'Demyelination, and remyelination by Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes after kainate-induced neuronal depletion in the central nervous system. Abstract Excitotoxins are thought to kill neurons while sparing afferent fibers and axons of passage. The validity of this classical conclusion has recently been questioned by the demonstration of axonal demyelination. In addition, axons are submitted to a profound alteration of their glial environment. This work was, therefore, undertaken to reassess axonoglial interactions over time after an excitotoxic lesion in the rat. Ultrastructural studies were carried out in the ventrobasal thalamus two days to 18 months after neuronal depletion by in situ injections of kainic acid. In some cases, lemniscal afferents were identified by using anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from the dorsal column nuclei. Two and four days after kainate injection, numerous dying axons displaying typical signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed in a neuropile characterized by the loss of neuronal somata and dendrites, an increase in number of microglia/macrophages and the disappearance of astrocytes. Ten and 12 days after kainate injection, degenerating axons were no longer observed although myelin degeneration of otherwise unaltered axons was ongoing with an accumulation of myelin remnants in the neuropile. At 16 and 20 days, the demyelination process was apparently complete and axons of different diameters were sometimes packed together. One and two months after kainate injection, the axonal environment changed again: remyelination of large-caliber axons occurred at the same time as reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and numerous Schwann cells appeared in the tissue. Schwann cell processes surrounded aggregates of axons of diverse calibers, ensheathed small ones and myelinated larger ones. Axons were also remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled lemniscal afferents could be myelinated by either of the two cell types. After three months, the neuropile exhibited an increase in number of hypertrophied astrocytes and the progressive loss of any other cellular or axonal element. At this stage, remaining Schwann cells were surrounded by a glia limitans formed by astrocytic processes. These data indicate that although excitotoxins are sparing the axons, they are having a profound and complex effect on the axonal environment. Demyelination occurs over the first weeks, accompanying the loss of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Axonal ensheathment and remyelination takes place in a second period, associated with the reappearance of oligodendrocytes and recruitment of numerous Schwann cells, while reactive astrocytes appear in the tissue at a slightly later time. Over the following months, astrocytes occupy a greater proportion of the neuron-depleted territory and other elements decrease in number. These successive stages in alteration of axonoglial interactions seem to evolve in parallel to the changes in density and terminal morphology that we described earlier for myelinated afferent fibers to the excitotoxic lesion.',\n 'Two neurotropic viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus, spread along different neural pathways from the main olfactory bulb. Abstract Several neurotropic viruses enter the brain after peripheral inoculation and spread transneuronally along pathways known to be connected to the initial site of entry. In this study, the pathways utilized by two such viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, were compared using in situ hybridization following inoculation into either the nasal cavity or the main olfactory bulb of the mouse. The results indicate that both viruses spread to infect a unique and only partially overlapping set of connections of the main olfactory bulb. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of infection of known primary and secondary main olfactory bulb connections. Using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase combined with in situ hybridization, it was shown that only herpes simplex virus infected noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, both viruses infected dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, although mouse hepatitis virus produced a more widespread infection in the A10 group, as well as infecting A8 and A9. The results suggest that differential virus uptake in specific neurotransmitter systems contributes to the pattern of viral spread, although other factors, such as differences in access to particular synapses on infected cells and differences in the distribution of the cellular receptor for the two viruses, are also likely to be important. The data show that neural tracing with different viruses may define unique neural pathways from a site of inoculation. The data also demonstrate that two viruses can enter the brain via the olfactory system and localize to different structures, suggesting that neurological diseases involving disparate regions of the brain could be caused by different viruses, even if entry occurred at a common site.',\n 'Molecular profile of reactive astrocytes—Implications for their role in neurologic disease. Abstract The central nervous system responds to diverse neurologic injuries with a vigorous activation of astrocytes. While this phenomenon is found in many different species, its function is obscure. Understanding the molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes should help define their function. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of molecules whose levels of expression differentiate activated from resting astrocytes and to use the molecular profile of reactive astrocytes as the basis for speculations on the functions of these cells. At present, reactive astrocytosis is defined primarily as an increase in the number and size of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. In vivo, this increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells reflects predominantly phenotypic changes of resident astroglia rather than migration or proliferation of such cells. Upon activation, astrocytes upmodulate the expression of a large number of molecules. From this molecular profile it becomes apparent that reactive astrocytes may benefit the injured nervous system by participating in diverse biological processes. For example, upregulation of proteases and protease inhibitors could help remodel the extracellular matrix, regulate the concentration of different proteins in the neuropil and clear up debris from degenerating cells. Cytokines are key mediators of immunity and inflammation and could play a critical role in the regulation of the blood-central nervous system interface. Neurotrophic factors, transporter molecules and enzymes involved in the metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids or in the antioxidant pathway may help protect neurons and other brain cells by controlling neurotoxin levels and contributing to homeostasis within the central nervous system. Therefore, an impairment of astroglial performance has the potential to exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Based on the synopsis of studies presented, a number of issues become apparent that deserve a more extensive analysis. Among them are the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes to early wound repair, the characterization of astroglial subpopulations, the specificity of the astroglial response in different diseases as well as the analysis of reactive astrocytes with techniques that can resolve fast physiologic processes. Differences between reactive astrocytes in vivo and primary astrocytes in culture are discussed and underline the need for the development and exploitation of models that will allow the analysis of reactive astrocytes in the intact organism.',\n 'Dorsal root ganglia may be reservoirs of viral infection in multiple sclerosis. Abstract There are presently two competitive theories that attempt to explain the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.',\n 'Effects of intravenously infused Fluosol-DA 20% in rats. Abstract Rats were injected with a fractionated 50 ml/kg dose of Fluosol®-DA 20% with and without exposure to 100% oxygen. Animals were killed at 24, 43, 92, and 183 days post-treatment and samples taken for hematological, hepatic enzyme, histological, and perfluorochemical analyses. There were no significant differences in hemograms or hepatic enzyme findings between treatment and control groups. Differences in organ weights and histology were a result of perfluorochemical (PFC) accumulation in the tissues of treated animals. All changes were reversible. There were no effects from breathing high oxygen levels in either treatment or control animals.',\n 'Effect of purified immunoglobulins or pooled colostrum on performance of rearing calves. Abstract Fifty Belgian white-blue male calves, purchased from the market at about 10 days of age, were divided into three groups. The basic diet was the same for all calves, and consisted of a restricted amount of commercial milk replacer containing 50 ppm zinc bacitracin and 20 pm virginiamycin, calf starter and grass hay. Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day−1, and grass hay was fed ad libitum. The experiment lasted 20 weeks. Group 1 (control) received the basic diet. Groups 2 and 3 were supplemented with either 2 g purified immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25-ml pooled colostrum (CO) twice daily, via the milk replacer as used in Group 1. Neither Ig nor CO exerted a positive effect on growth rate and feed efficiency. Six calves died: two, one and three in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Their serum IG content was significantly lower than that of the surviving animals. Mechanisms explaining the lack of any protective effect are discussed. It is supposed that the main reason was due to the gap between the CO feeding at birth and the onset of the administration of Ig or CO at the start of the experiment. At that time, 31 of the 50 calves excreted rota-and/or coronaviruses.',\n 'Antibiotics in feed, with special reference to pigs: a veterinary viewpoint. Abstract The historical background of the present UK legislation is briefly reviewed, and the current legal situation as it pertains to the UK and European Community is summarised. The reasons for the inclusion of antibiotics in feed are outlined and discussed. In the first case, feedstuffs may have to be medicated for reasons of disease prevention and control. In large herds, especially in loose housing, mass medication by injection is not possible and even minimal disease herds will become infected with airborne pathogens from time to time. In the second case, continuous low-level feeding of antibiotics to growing pigs (growth promoters) suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria and allows healthier pigs to grow faster and more efficiently, thus producing cheaper food at the same time as improving welfare. The legal requirements regarding medicines available only on prescription are outlined and discussed. The fears and worries of the general public are noted and found to be overstated because of misconceptions and misunderstanding. It is concluded that food and milk produced today will remain safe provided the safety rules are adhered to.',\n 'Interaction of mouse hepatitis virus 3 with Kupffer cells explanted from susceptible and resistant mouse strains. Antiviral activity, interleukin-1 synthesis. Abstract The genetic sensitivity of mouse strains to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV 3) has been related in vitro to a delay of virus replication in liver sinusoidal cells. In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.',\n 'Identification and sequence determination of the capsid protein gene of human astrovirus serotype 1. Abstract We present the sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) at the 3′ end of human astrovirus serotype 1. Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein of M r 85 540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.',\n \"Sequencing of coronavirus IBV genomic RNA: a 195-base open reading frame encoded by mRNA B. Abstract DNA sequencing of genomic cDNA clones of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been carried out. 770 bases have been determined which include genomic sequences spanning the 5' termini of the two smallest mRNAs of the 3'-coterminal “nested” set: mRNA A and mRNA B. This region contains the complete coding sequences for mRNA B which are additional to those present in mRNA A. Two open reading frames are present, predicting proteins of M rs 7500 and 9500.\",\n 'A general method for the induction and screening of antisera for cDNA-encoded polypeptides: antibodies specific for a coronavirus putative polymerase-encoding gene. Abstract A prokaryotic vector, pGE374, containing the recA and lacZ genes, out-of-frame, was used for the expression of cDNA derived from the putative polymerase-encoding gene of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active β-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA. This strategy was shown to successfully result in the specific generation of antibodies to the encoded information of the viral cDNA. Furthermore, this method has general applicability in the generation and characterization of antibodies directed against proteins encoded in cDNAs.',\n \"Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences. Abstract A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.\",\n 'Mapping of a region of dengue virus type-2 glycoprotein required for binding by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Abstract Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.',\n 'Expression of the Bgp gene and characterization of mouse colon biliary glycoprotein isoforms. Abstract The biliary glycoprotein (BGP)-encoding gene is a member of the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. We have now cloned several mouse Bgp cDNAs from an outbred CDR-1 mouse colon cDNA library, as well as by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA. The distinguishing features of the deduced Bgp protein isoforms are found in the two divergent N-terminal domains, the highly conserved internal C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and an intracytoplasmic domain of either 10 or 73 amino acids (aa). The cDNA structures suggest that these mRNAs are produced through alternative splicing of a Bgp gene and the usage of multiple transcriptional terminators. The Bgp deduced aa sequences are highly homologous to several well characterized rat hepatocyte proteins such as the cell CAM105/ecto-ATPase/ppl20/HA4 proteins. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes representing the various cDNA isoform domains revealed predominant transcripts of 1.8, 3.1 and 4.0 kb on Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA; some of these bands are actually composed of several co-migrating transcripts. The transcripts encoding the long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins are expressed at one-tenth the relative abundance of the shorter-tailed species. We have previously demonstrated that several mouse Bgp cDNAs, when transfected into eukaryotic cells, express BGP proteins at the cell surface and function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules, much like their human and rat counterparts. The expression of the many Bgp isoforms at the surface of epithelial cells, such as colon, suggests that these proteins play a determinant role, through self- or heterologous contact, in renewal and/or differentiation of their epithelia.',\n \"Identification of unusual RNA folding patterns encoded by bacteriophage T4 gene 60. Abstract A 50-nucleotide (nt) untranslated region (coding gap sequence) that interrupts the amino acid coding sequence in T4 gene 60, plus an additional 5 nt upstream and another 3 nt downstream from the gap sequence, shows unusual folding patterns according to RNA structure prediction. A predicted highly stable and significant hairpin structure in the 5' half of the gap sequence and a plausible tertiary structural element computed in the 3' part of the gap sequence seem significant by statistical tests on the wild-type (wt) sequence. This feature is absent in insertion, deletion and substitution variants of the gap sequence, in which template activities are markedly lower than that of the wt. The proposed feature is consistent with currently available data showing that the translational bypass of the coding gap is correlated with a stop codon involved in a stem-loop structure folded in the gap sequence. We suggest that the role of this segment in “ribosomal bypass” of a portion of the mRNA sequence is a property of its special folded structure.\",\n 'Permissible peptide insertions surrounding the signal peptide-mature protein junction of the ClpG prepilin: CS31A fimbriae of Escherichia coli as carriers of foreign sequences. Abstract The clpG gene, expressing the Escherichia coli major CS31A fimbrial subunit ClpG, was subjected to random mutagenesis by insertion of an EcoRI linker and a kanamycin-resistance (KmR) cassette into the multiple newly generated EcoRI sites. The KmR gene was then excised by PstI, which left a 48-bp linker representing the heterologous sequence. The same procedure was followed to introduce a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) corresponding to epitope C from the spike protein S from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Nine insertion/deletion mutants (indels) that contained long foreign peptides variously located around the ClpG signal peptide (SP) processing site were characterized. A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These ‘permissive’ sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy. Therefore, the CS31A fimbria seems to be a potent tool for the presentation of foreign antigenic determinants or the production of heterologous polypeptides in E. coli.',\n 'Replication of a bovine coronavirus in organ cultures of foetal trachea. Abstract A strain of bovine coronavirus (BC) adapted to tissue culture, was inoculated into organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea. Haemagglutinin in the fluid from infected organ cultures reached titres of 32 and characteristic coronavirus particles were observed electron microscopically. BC virus antigen was detected in frozen sections of the organ cultures by staining with fluorescent antibody. These data were evidence that BC virus replicated in organ cultures of respiratory tissue. The use of this technique for primary isolation of bovine coronaviruses from field material is discussed.',\n 'Physico-chemical properties of calf-diarrhea coronavirus. Abstract Replication of calf diarrhea coronavirus was not inhibited by 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine, indicating that the virus is an RNA virus. Sensitivity to ether and chloroform indicated that the virus is enveloped, and this was confirmed by electron microscopic observation of the virion. The virus was readily inactivated by trypsin and sodium deoxycholate. The virus was labile at 50°C in diluted medium, but readily stabilized in the presence of MgCl2. It was stable at pH 5 and 7, while a slight loss of infectivity was observed at pH 3. The virus was readily filtered through membrane filters of 200 and 100-nm pore sizes, but not through 50-nm filters. The buoyant density of the virion in CsCl was estimated to be 1.25 g/ml.',\n 'Hemagglutination by calf diarrhea coronavirus. Abstract The virus was grown in BEK-1 cells, a stable cell line from bovine embryo kidney, and tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes of a variety of species at 4°C, room temperature and 37°C. HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, mouse, rat, and hamster erythrocytes but not with erthyrocytes of human (O), cattle, horses, sheep, guinea pigs, geese, ducks, pigeons and 1-day-old chicks. Chickens showed an individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in HA and HA inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out.',\n 'Isolation of coronaviruses from neonatal calf diarrhoea in Great Britain and Denmark. Abstract Coronaviruses were isolated from neonatal calves with diarrhoea in Great Britain and Denmark. They were serially passed in gnotobiotic calves which developed acute diarrhoea. Pathological lesions were found in the small and large intestines. Coronaviruses were demonstrated by electron microscopic examination of the faeces and intestinal contents, immunofluorescent staining of sections of small and large intestine and by isolation in tracheal organ cultures. In early passages of the British coronavirus, particles of about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the faeces by electron microscopy. These particles were removed from the coronavirus preparations by cross-protection experiments in calves. The coronaviruses were morphologically and antigenically similar to the bovine coronavirus isolated in the United States and the British virus was adapted to replicate in calf kidney cell cultures.',\n 'Cross-protection studies between feline infectious peritonitis and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis viruses. Abstract Cross-protection studies between the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) viruses were conducted in cats, pigs and pregnant gilts. Cats vaccinated with TGE virus developed neutralizing antibodies against TGE virus and low titer antibody against FIP virus detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique but were not protected against a virulent FIP virus challenge. Baby pigs and pregnant gilts vaccinated with FIP virus did not develop detectable antibodies to TGE virus. Nevertheless, it appeared that vaccination of swine with FIP virus conferred some immunity against TGE virus infection. Seventeen-day-old pigs vaccinated with two doses of FIP virus had a 67% survival rate following a virulent TGE virus challenge, and 75% of the 3-day-old pigs suckling either FIP or TGE-virus-vaccinated gilts survived virulent TGE virus infection in contrast to 0% survival of baby pigs suckling unvaccinated gilts.',\n 'Antigenicity of structural components from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract Pregnant sows were inoculated with inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus and with preparations of virus surface projections and subviral particles derived by detergent treatment of the virus. Neutralising antibody was demonstrated in serum and colostrum from animals that received whole virus or preparations of surface projections whereas subviral particles failed to stimulate neutralising antibody formation. Similar results were obtained with serum from rabbits inoculated with whole virus and structural components. All three preparations stimulated the formation of agglutinating antibodies, as demonstrated by sedimentation analysis and filtration studies with radiolabelled virus. The immunoglobulin classes responsible for neutralising antibody activity in sows inoculated by the intramammary route were examined. In each case where the immunoglobulin class was determined, IgG was found. One sow that received surface projections also had IgA with neutralising activity in her colostrum. In contrast, infection of sows with live whole virus resulted in neutralising antibody of the IgG, IgM and IgA classes.',\n 'Detection of coronavirus in calf faeces with a haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination assay (HEHA). Abstract A simple and rapid procedure has been developed for the detection of bovine coronaviruses in faecal specimens. The method consists of adsorption of the virus onto mouse erythrocytes at 4°C, removal of unadsorbed material and elution of adsorbed viral material at 37°C. The eluate is then used in a haemagglutination test. Specificity of the reaction is checked by a blocking assay. No non-specific reactions have been observed. The sensitivity of the test appeared to be better than that of the electron microscope, at least when crude faecal extracts are used. By ultracentrifugation of the eluates the sensitivity of the assay can be further improved.',\n 'Effects of ambient temperatures on clinical and immune responses of pigs infected with transmissible gastro-enteritis virus. Abstract Two- to three-months-old pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed no clinical response when housed at 30°C, but comparable infected pigs exposed to temperature changes from 30°C to 4°C following infection showed typical signs of TGE. Development of TGE-specific immune responses, as measured by blastogenic response of tissue lymphocytes, occurred at 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) in pigs held at 30°C, but not until 7 DPI in infected pigs held under the adverse conditions. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids resulted in a fall in circulatory T cells, lowering of non-specific blastogenic response of circulatory lymphocytes, and clinical signs of disease when immunosuppressed pigs were infected with TGE virus and held at 30°C. It is suggested that clinical responses to TGE virus infection may be affected by the influence of ambient temperatures on the immune responses of pigs.',\n 'Epizootic diarrhoea of adult cattle associated with a coronavirus-like agent. Abstract An epizootic of acute diarrhoea of adult cattle occured in Japan during the winter of 1976 to 1977. A majority of adult cattle clinically diagnosed as having the disease, showed a significant rises in antibody titres to bovine coronavirus, whereas only a smal; minority showed serological evidence of recent infection with calf rotavirus, bovine adenovirus type 7, parainfluenza virus type 3, or bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus. A coronavirus-like agent was detected by electron-microscopy in faecal material from a cow with diarrhoea, and was subsequently isolated in primary bovine kidney cell cultures.',\n 'Properties of a coronavirus isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea. Abstract A coronavirus (Kakegawa isolate) isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea was grown in BEK-1 cells and examined for biophysical and biochemical properties. The Kakegawa isolate was able to replicate in the presence or absence of 5-iodo-2′-deoxy-uridine, indicating that its viral nucleic acid was RNA. It was highly sensitive to ether and chloroform, and moderately sensitive to trypsin and heat. It was, however, readily stabilized by treatment with cation at 50°C for 1 h. Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3.0. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but not through one of 100 nm pore size. The buoyant density of the virus was determined in a sucrose density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was found at a density of 1.182. Neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests showed a close serological relationship between the Kakegawa isolate and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus.',\n 'Differentiation of canine coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus by neutralization with canine, porcine and feline sera. Abstract Monospecific antisera were prepared in rabbits against canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs (TGEV), and in 24 pigs and 3 cats against TGEV alone. Neutralizing antibody titres were higher for the immunizing than the heterologous virus, although cross-neutralization usually was detected. This confirmed that CCV and TGEV are distinct, but antigenically related coronaviruses. In sera from 41 dogs, CCV-neutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than TGEV-neutralizing titres, suggesting that CCV was the causal agent. Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV. The FIP virus (FIPV) is probably more closely related to CCV than TGEV as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization. Antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus, three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229E strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize CCV and TGEV. Thus CCV, TGEV and probably FIPV fall into a group of antigenically related agents, separable from other members of the family Coronaviridae, by both virus neutralization and immunofluorescence tests.',\n 'Inhibitors of bovine parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus in precolostral and fetal bovine sera. Abstract Eleven, 11 and 2 of 11 precolostral sera from normal calves and 13, 14 and 9 of 14 sera from normal fetuses, 7 to 10 months of gestation, neutralized bovine parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus, respectively. When assayed by single radial immunodiffusion, all the sera contained IgG at 360 to 1400 mg/dl, and some of them had much smaller amounts of IgM or IgA. Most of the neutralizing activities against bovine coronavirus and rotavirus were readily inactivated by treatment with acetone or 2-mercaptoethanol. Some sera fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration or starch block electrophoresis had neutralizing activities against bovine parvovirus or coronavirus in fractions containing no detectable amounts of immunoglobulins. These observations seem to indicate the presence of substance(s), other than immunoglobulins, capable of inhibiting replication of bovine parvovirus, coronavirus or rotavirus. The chemical nature and the mode of action of the inhibitors await elucidation.',\n 'The pathogenesis of an enteric infection in pigs, experimentally induced by the coronavirus-like agent, CV 777. Abstract Sixteen 2–3-days-old caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were each dosed oro-nasally with 2 ml of a bacteria-free filtrate containing 104 pig-infectious-doses of CV 777. The piglets were killed at intervals of 12 to 120 h after infection. The coronvirus-like agent caused a local infection of the intestinal tract which resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea. The pathogenesis of this infection was similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a known coronaviral infection of pigs. However, where were some differences. By immunofluorescent staining, CV 777 antigens were not only detected in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi, but also in the cells of the colonic surface epithelium. Occasional fluorescence was also seen in the small intestinal crypt epithelium, but the regenerative capacity of the crypts was not affected. The progress of intestinal epithelial cell infection by CV 777 was much slower than that in TGE, resulting in a longer incubation period and in less drastic epithelial cell destruction. The infection of regenerating cells occurred to a much higher degree during the late stage of a CV 777 infection than has been observed in TGE.',\n 'Detection of rotavirus infection by immunodiffusion. Abstract Three precipitin reactions associated with bovine rotavirus infection were demonstrable by immunodiffusion. One of the reactions has been utilized in a diagnostic test for the detection of rotavirus in faeces, or specific antibody to rotavirus group antigen in serum or faeces. The test, based on bovine materials, appeared to be group-specific and effective in demonstrating rotaviral antigen or antibody in other species of animals, including human beings. The procedure was as efficient as electron microscopy in detecting evidence of rotavirus in faeces of calves and a range of other species.',\n 'Interaction of rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in conventionally-reared dairy calves. Abstract A study was made of the effects of rotavirus and/or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on dairy calves born and suckled on the farm and subsequently reared in isolation. Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in convenstional calves of this age.',\n 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the coronavirus-like agent and its antibodies in pigs with porcine epidemic diarrhea. Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of the coronavirus-like agent in feces of pigs naturally affected with porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) or experimentally infected with the CV777 isolate. The assay was specific and more sensitive than electron microscopy. An ELISA blocking assay is described for the detection and titration of antibodies. Specific antibody formation was demonstrated in pigs experimentally infected with CV777 and in swine naturally affected with PED.',\n 'Studies with an unclassified virus isolated from diarrheic calves. Abstract A transmissible agent (Breda agent) was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and shown to be infectious by inoculation orally into gnotobiotic and conventionally reared calves. The “Breda” agent had the morphology of a virus and possessed a hemagglutinin. Antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus (BVD). Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7–9 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17–20 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofluorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus. Fourteen of fortyseven calves in the outbreak were infected with the virus, virus was not identified in other farm outbreaks of the disease.',\n 'Studies of enteric coronaviruses in a feline cell line. Abstract Development is reported of a feline cell line which can support the growth of coronaviruses from canine (CCV), feline (FIPV) and porcine (TGEV) species. The cell culture has been serially transferred over 100 times and has retained its initial growth requirements, proliferative capacity and morphologic features. Each virus had specific growth characteristics in this cell culture although all produced a similar CPE and plaques under agar. Cross neutralization studies demonstrated a two-way relationship between TGEV and CCV and between TGEV and FIPV, whereas a one-way relationship was demonstrated between CCV and FIPV.',\n 'Inducement of cytopathic changes and plaque formation by porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Abstract ESK cells were shown to be a good medium for propagating the 67N strain of porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, although no cytopathic effect was observed. The virus induced a readily recognizable cytopathic effect in ESK cells, when a non-cytotoxic amount of diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) was incorporated in the culture medium. Based on this finding, a sensitive, practical assay method for the virus was developed. When DEAE-dextran was incorporated in the agar overlay medium, 67N virus formed plaques in ESK cell monolayers. The cytopathic effect as well as the plaque formation were specifically inhibited by antisera against the virus. Neutralization tests were developed on the basis of these findings. Neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition tests on swine serum samples indicated a wide dissemation of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus or antigenically-related viruses in Japanese pigs.',\n 'Intestinal changes associated with rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection in calves. Abstract Newborn calves inoculated with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) serotype 020:K′ × 106′:K99:HNM, either alone or in combination, became depressed, anorectic, diarrhoeic and dehydrated. ETEC did not adhere to the intestine although there was extensive proliferation in the lumen. Only slight mucosal changes were induced by ETEC and the activity of membrane bound lactase remained normal. More severe mucosal damage and a decrease in lactase activity were found in newborn calves inoculated with either rotavirus or rotavirus and ETEC in combination. The most severe clinical illness was found in calves inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC. Calves inoculated at 1 week of age with either rotavirus or ETEC remained clinically normal. Rotavirus infection produced slight mucosal changes and a reduction of lactase activity. In contrast, colostrum-fed or suckling calves up to 2 weeks old inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC became clinically affected, showed severe mucosal damage and decreased lactase activity. There was no bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa as observed by immunofluorescent labelling and light microscopy.',\n 'Antibodies to berne virus in horses and other animals. Abstract After inoculation into 2 foals, Berne virus induced neutralizing antibody, but did not cause clinical symptoms. In a horizontal study of seropositive mares and their offspring, a decline of maternal antibodies and a sudden synchronous seroconversion in all foals were observed, again without clinical symptoms. The virus is widespread in the Swiss horse population and has been so during the last decade; rises in antibody titers were noted in 9% of paired sera sampled at random. Positive reactions were also obtained in serum neutralization tests and ELISA using small numbers of horse sera from Germany, France and the U.S.A. The results of neutralization tests and ELISA were correlated in 83% of random samples tested; 13% were neutralization-positive and ELISA-negative and in 4% the inverse was observed. Neutralizing activity was found in the sera of other ungulates (cattle, goat, sheep and pig), laboratory rabbits and 2 species of wild mice (Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus). Inconclusive results were obtained with feline and human sera; those from dogs and foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were consistently negative. The probable occurrence of antigenic variants in Berne-type viruses is discussed.',\n 'Coronavirus infection of the bovine respiratory tract. Abstract Two viruses, morphologically resembling coronaviruses and antigenically indistinguishable from bovine enteric coronavirus, were isolated in bovine tracheal organ cultures from the lungs and trachea of young calves with respiratory disease. Intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of these viruses into neonatal calves resulted in a predominantly upper respiratory tract infection, which was associated with the development of mild respiratory symptoms.',\n 'Resistance of Berne virus to physical and chemical treatment. Abstract Thermal inactivation of Berne virus proceeded at a linear rate between 31°C and 43°C. Storage at temperatures lower than −20°C preserved the infectivity, while at 4°C appreciable loss occurred between 92 and 185 days. Freeze-drying or desiccation at 22°C caused only insignificant loss of infectivity. Virus preparations were not affected by pH values between 2.5 and 10.3. Inactivation by UV occurred more rapidly than with herpes, toga and rhabdoviruses. Berne virus infectivity was sensitive to pronase and B. subtilis proteinase. It was not inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment, which resulted in enhancement of infectivity; low concentrations of pronase (< 10 μg ml−1) had a similar effect on Berne virus. Neither phospholipase C or RNase, alone or in combination, nor sodium deoxycholate (0.1%) inactivated the virus; in contrast, Triton X-100 (0.1%, 1.0%) caused rapid inactivation with a constant level of residual infectivity.',\n 'The role of interferon in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity in pigs. Abstract Specific release of 51Cr and the production of interferon (IFN) increased in parallel in a spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) assay in which uninfected PK-15 cells or PK-15 cells persistently infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PK-15-TGE cells) were used as targets, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from a young adult pig were used as effector cells. Higher levels of both specific 51Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the 51Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of 51Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay the effects of IFN pretreatment on the effector adult PBL and on the PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were confirmed, and SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal piglets were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN pretreatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency.',\n 'Significance of Clostridium spiroforme in the enteritis-complex of commercial rabbits. Abstract Commercial rabbits showing clinical signs of enteritis-complex were examined for the presence of Clostridium spiroforme and its iota-like toxin. The bacterium was detected by Gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. From 29 strains of C. spiroforme tested, 26 were toxigenic, originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries. In 13.4% of the samples, C. spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent. Gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature. In the other samples, C. spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing Escherichia coli (29.5%), Bacillus piliformis (10.3%), rotaviruses (25.6%), coronavirus (2.6%), Eimeria spp. (44.9%) and cryptosporidia (6.4%). In 33.3% of C. spiroforme-containing samples, more than one of these agents was present. There was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in C. spiroforme-positive and negative samples. On the basis of these results as well as that of previous data, we suggest that C. spiroforme-mediated diarrhea is favoured by maldigestion, initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors.',\n 'Dysentery in calves caused by an atypical strain of Escherichia coli (S102-9). Abstract Dysentery lasting 4–8 days was produced in five 4-day-old colostrum-fed calves, after inoculation with an atypical strain of Escherichia coli S102-9; peak excretion of S102-9 occurred during the period of dysentery. Two calves were killed when clinical signs were most severe and bacteria were seen attached to the surfaces of enterocytes in the large intestine; microscopic lesions were seen in these areas. The lesions were identical to those previously reported in a natural outbreak of dysentery in calves, from which E. coli S102-9 was isolated, and to those seen in gnotobiotic calves experimentally infected with S102-9. Reinfection of the three surviving calves 16–20 days later with S102-9 and primary infection of two calves aged 24 and 51 days did not cause dysentery. Four of 659 coliforms isolated from field outbreaks of calf diarrhoea resembled the atypical strain S102-9. These four isolates and S102-9 did not produce heat-stable enterotoxin, but all produced a toxin cytopathic for Vero and HeLa cells. Two of the four isolates were inoculated alone into 4-day-old gnotobiotic calves deprived of colostrum; neither calf developed dysentery but microscopic lesions identical to those produced by S102-9 were detected in the large intestines of both animals.',\n 'Antigenic variation of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus detected by monoclonal antibodies. Abstract Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/O) were fused with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus, and 21 monoclonal (MC) antibodies reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the TO-163 strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus were obtained. Of these MC antibodies, 14, 6 and 1 were IgG1, IgG2a and IgM, respectively. All of the MC antibodies contained light chains of the kappa type. Of these MC antibodies, 8 were found to have neutralization (NT) activity against the TO-163 strain. Comparison of 7 strains of TGE virus by NT tests using our panel of MC antibodies confirmed their close antigenic relationships, but also revealed the occurence of distinct antigenic differences. These results suggest that there may be at least 6 different epitopes involved in NT reaction on the virion of the TO-163 strain. This notion was confirmed by the competitive binding assay.',\n 'Studies on bovine breda virus. Abstract Diarrheic feces from 21 calves were examined by electron microscopy and 16 contained particles morphologically similar to those of Breda virus. The particles were spherical or elongated, 60–270 nm in greatest dimension and had surface spikes 9–13 nm long. Convalescent serum from a human patient with Breda virus-associated diarrhea reacted with one of the bovine viruses by immune electron microscopy, suggesting a serological resemblance between human and bovine Breda-like viruses. Immune electron-microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that isolates of bovine Breda virus from the U.S.A. were related to the French virus. One of the viruses had a density in sucrose solution of 1.16, similar to the value for Berne virus.',\n 'Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine: In vitro virus attachment and effects of polyanions and polycations. Abstract Four transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains (Purdue-115, D-52, 188-SG and Gep-II) and two cell lines (swine testis-ST and pig kidney-RPD) were used to study virus attachment and cell susceptibility. Virus attachment was partially thermodependent and the rate varied, depending on the strain. Identical TGEV inocula produced a higher plaque number by plaque assay in the swine testis cell line (ST) than in the pig kidney cell line (RPD) but [3H]uridine-labèlled virus was found associated equally well with both cell lines. A field TGEV strain (Gep-II), which was unable to multiply in cell cultures, appeared able to inhibit the attachment of radiolabelled cell-passaged virus. Therefore, the susceptibility to TGEV infection was apparently not determined at the virus-to-cell attachment stage. The attachment sites on the cell surface were specific, however, differences in TGEV attachment determinant between strains were not observed. Attachment of all the virus strains tested was enhanced by DEAE-dextran and inhibited by dextran sulfate, poly-L-lysine (PLL), poly-L-α-ornithine (PLO) and protamine sulfate.',\n 'Growth of Mycoplasma bovis in organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea and comparison with Mycoplasma dispar. Abstract Inoculation of tracheal organ cultures from bovine foetuses with Mycoplasma bovis resulted in a loss of cellular structure of the lamina propria, followed 20–22 days later by lifting and detachment of overlying epithelium. The effect was associated with large numbers of M. bovis, identified by immunoperoxidase labelling and electromicroscopy, infiltrating between the epithelial cells and amassing in the lamina propria, especially in the region of the basement membrane of the epithelium. Ciliary activity was undiminished for up to 18 days following inoculation and little or no cytopathic effect on the ciliated epithelium was seen in spite of the close proximity of large numbers of organisms. In contrast, M. dispar was restricted to the margin of the ciliated epithelium where, as previously reported, it caused pyknosis, sloughing and flattening of the epithelium with consequent loss of ciliary activity. The cytopathology observed for each mycoplasma bore a close similarity to the behaviour of the two mycoplasmas in vivo and it is suggested that the organ culture system may be a useful and relevant system to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms for each mycoplasma.',\n 'A comparison of three rapid diagnostic methods for the detection of rotavirus infection in calves. Abstract Three techniques for the detection of rotavirus in faecal samples from calves with neonatal gastroenteritis were compared. A preliminary study indicated that reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) was at least as sensitive as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These two immunoassays were compared with the detection of viral RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 209 field samples. Of the 77 samples in which at least one test gave a positive result, 69 were positive by both RPHA and PAGE, but only 49 were also positive by ELISA, indicating a lower sensitivity for the latter test. The overall agreement between RPHA and PAGE was 96%. The reasons for the discrepancies between the tests are discussed.',\n 'Characterisation of rotavirus isolates from sub-clinically infected calves by genome profile analysis. Abstract Rotaviruses isolated from 43 sub-clinically infected calves from a single farm were analysed by genome profile analysis. The isolates showed genomic variation and eight different profiles were observed, including one which was atypical for Group A rotaviruses. The 3′ terminal labelling method for the analysis of genome profiles used in this study required only 1 ng of viral RNA, an increase of 1000-fold in sensitivity over ethidium bromide staining for detecting all rotavirus genome segments. However, dual infections involving two rotaviruses with distinct profiles could not be detected if the concentrations of the viruses differed by > 10-fold.',\n 'Characterization of rotaviruses isolated from pigs with diarrhoea in Venezuela. Abstract The prevalence of porcine rotavirus infection was studied in 15 different herds located in the north-western region of Venezuela. The presence of rotavirus was studied by direct electron microscopy (EM) and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 136 samples analyzed during the six months of the study (September 1983–February 1984), 38 (27.9%) were found to be positive for rotaviruses, with infection more common in animals that were 4–6 weeks old. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds. Great variability in the RNA electropherotypes was observed. No correlation was found between subgroup specificity and the migration of the two smaller segments (Genes 10 and 11), as has been described for human rotaviruses.',\n 'Evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus antibodies. Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus was developed for detection of antibody against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus in swine serum. The ELISA demonstrated antibody responses in pigs immunized intramuscularly with the attenuated TO-163 strain of TGE virus and in pigs orally infected with the virulent Shizuoka strain of the virus. The results of the ELISA were well correlated with those of the neutralization test. These results indicate the usefulness of the ELISA as a serological tool for TGE virus antibody.',\n 'Effect of experimentally-induced villus atrophy on adhesion of K88ac-positive Escherichia coli in just-weaned piglets. Abstract Three- to four-week-old, just-weaned piglets were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and the next day with K88ac+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Histological examination of caudal jejunum and ileum of piglets killed 2–3 days after virus challenge (1–2 days after ETEC infection) revealed severe villus atrophy especially in the jejunum compared with controls (P<0.05). Four-5 days after TGE virus infection villus length increased and after 7 days it was near normal. Villi scraped from jejunal and ileal mucosa of the piglets were incubated in vitro with K88ac+ E. coli and the number of bacteria adhering to 250 μm villus brush border was counted. Attachment of bacteria to villi of piglets killed 2–3 days after TGE virus infection was significantly decreased in comparison with adhesion to villi of non-infected piglets or of piglets killed 7 days after the virus infection. Correlation between in vitro adhesion and villus height was 0.6649 (P<0.001). The results suggest that the experimentally-induced villus atrophy was attended with a temporarily diminished susceptibility of villus enterocytes to adhesion of K88ac+ E. coli.',\n 'Virus shedding and immune responses in cats inoculated with cell culture-adapted feline infectious peritonitis virus. Abstract Eight specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated orally or parenterelly with a cell culture-adapted strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Faeces and oropharyngeal swabs were monitored daily for infectious virus by inoculation of feline embryo long cells. Virus was recovered from both sites for ∼ 2 weeks after inoculation, before clinical signs of disease developed. Peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from these cats were tested in an in-vitro blastogenic assay using concanavalin A (con A) and FIPV antigen. All cats showed a profound suppression of the response to con A which only recovered to pre-inoculation levels in 2 cats, one of which survived. These 2 cats also responded to FIPV antigen on the 21st day after infection, the greater response being in the survivor. The other cats, surviving 16–18 days, developed no response to FIPV antigen. Antibody titres, measured by immunofluorescence and by virus neutralization, rose rapidly to very high levels in all cats, regardless of the route of inoculation.',\n 'Lack of protection in vivo with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) specific for the E1 and E2 surface glycoproteins of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were examined either alone or in combination to evaluate their potential value in protecting neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. Cesarean-delivered colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets were given one pre-challenge dose of Mab and an equal dose of the same Mab at each successive feeding after challenge. In vivo challenge results demonstrated that neither Mabs given individually nor combinations of the Mabs were able to protect neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. However, in parallel experiments, polyclonal antibodies from immune colostrum or serum were protective.',\n 'The sites of early viral replication in feline infectious peritonitis. Abstract The sites of early replication of feline infectious peritonitis virus were tudied following oral inoculation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats with virus grown in cell cultures. Viral antigen was first detected by immunofluorescence in the tonsils and small intestine within 24 h of inoculation, and was later found in caecum, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. However, histological changes in the gut did not appear until relatively late in the course of infection. Virus was recovered from the oropharynx and the faeces from as early as the second or third day after inoculation, and shedding continued until euthanasia.',\n 'A competitive inhibition ELISA for the differentiation of serum antibodies from pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or with the TGEV-related porcine respiratory coronavirus. Abstract A competitive inhibition ELISA was developed to detect non-neutralizing antibodies to the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in porcine sera using a monoclonal antibody as an indicator. It was demonstrated that field strains of the TGEV-related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) did not induce this antibody, whereas the Miller strain and field strains of TGEV did. The sensitivity of the competitive inhibition ELISA appeared to be similar to that of the virus neutralization (VN) test. The test enables differentiation of pigs which were previously infected with TGEV or PRCV and which cannot be distinguished by the classical anti-TGEV neutralization test. The present test is useful for selective serodiagnosis.',\n 'Ultrastructure and protein A-gold immunolabelling of HRT-18 cells infected with turkey enteric coronavirus. Abstract The Minnesota strain of turkey enteric coronavirus (TCV) was propagated in HRT-18 cells, a cell line derived from human rectum adenocarcinoma. A productive non-cytopathic infection was established, without a previous adaptation, in these cells as shown by the specific hemagglutinating activity in cell culture supernatants. A post-embedding immunochemical technique, using specific antiserum directed against the original egg-adapted virus and colloidal-gold-labelled protein A as the electron-dense marker, was used for the identification of the virus and related antigens in the cells by electron microscopy. Budding of typical coronavirus particles, through intracytoplasmic membranes and accumulation of complete virus within cytoplasmic vesicles or the lumen of rough endoplasmic reticulum, were the main features of the viral morphogenesis. Late in infection, numerous progeny viral particles were shown at the outer surface of infected cells, but budding could not be demonstrated at this level. Two different types of surface projections were observed on the extracellular particles of this avian coronavirus. These morphological characteristics have been thus far described only for mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses.',\n 'Natural infection with the porcine respiratory coronavirus induces protective lactogenic immunity against transmissible gastroenteritis. Abstract Our objective was to evaluate the level of passive protection against transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) among 57 newborn piglets nursing from seven seropositive sows previously naturally infected with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). After challenge exposure we observed mortality rates of 44% for litters of seven PRCV-infected sows, 40% for litters of four sows orally immunized with the attenuated TGEV strain Nouzilly, and 91% for litters of seven seronegative susceptible sows. A blocking ELISA with two appropriate monoclonal antibodies distinguished serological responses of PRCV-infected sows from those of TGEV-immunized sows. The results suggest that natural infection of the sow with PRCV may induce a degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGE.',\n 'Purification of infectious bronchitis coronavirus by Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography. Abstract A procedure was developed to purify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by gel chromatography (GC) with a Sephacryl S-1000 column. Virus samples concentrated by centrifugation were applied to a Sephacryl S-1000 column and eluted by 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 M NaCl. Virus particles were recovered mainly in the first peak. Purity of the samples was evaluated by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy, it was found that there were more spike-rich particles in the virus samples purified by GC than in those purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC). In addition, the hemagglutination unit [log10 (infectivity titer/hemagglutination titer)] of GC-purified virus samples was ∼ 10 times lower than that of SDGC-purified virus samples. These results indicate that Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography is useful for purification of IBV.',\n 'Characterization of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to bovine enteric coronavirus: Establishment of an efficient ELISA for antigen detection in feces. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to bovine enteric coronavirus (BEC) were produced. Additionally, polyclonal antibodies were made in rabbits and guinea pigs and extracted from the yolk of immunized hens. The antibodies were characterized by neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. Neutralizing antibody titers of polyclonal antisera ranged from 1:1280 to 1:40 000. Only one out of 908 hybridoma colonies tested secreted antibodies with neutralizing activity. By ELISA, polyclonal sera exhibited high background reactions that could be significantly reduced by treatment with kaolin in the case of rabbit sera. Attempts to establish an ELISA for BEC antigen detection based on polyclonal sera failed due to low sensitivity and specificity. Optimal results were achieved when a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies was coated onto microplates for antigen capture, while rabbit hyperimmune serum served as detecting antibodies in an indirect assay. The combination of the two monoclonal antibodies did not increase sensitivity synergistically, but in a compensatory fashion, probably because of epitope differences between BEC field strains.',\n 'Quantitation, biological and physicochemical properties of cell culture-adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV). Abstract The porcine epidemic coronavirus (PEDV), tentatively classified as a coronavirus, was adapted to Vero cells and a plaque test developed for infectivity titration, allowing us to test the biological and biophysical properties of the virus. Growth kinetics showed peak titers of 105.5 plaque-forming units ml−1 15 h after infection. Filtration experiments and electron microscopy revealed a particle diameter between 100 and 200 nm. The bouyant density of the virus was 1.18. The particle lost its infectivity on treatment with lipid solvents. Virus replication could not be inhibited by 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine. PEDV was moderately stable at 50°C, but heat sensitivity was not altered by divalent cations. At 4°C, the virus was stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0, but at 37°C stability was restricted to the pH range 6.5–7.5. Viral infectivity was not impaired by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. PEDV was not neutralized by transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum. On the basis of the tests carried out, PEDV is a pleomorphic, enveloped RNA virus with a particle diameter of ∼ 150 nm and a bouyant density of 1.18. Infectivity depends on the presence of trypsin, and infected cells show a tendency to fuse and to form syncytia. All of these properties, as well as its physicochemical characteristics, allow PEDV to be classified as a coronavirus.',\n 'Inhibitory effects of ribavirin alone or combined with human alpha interferon on feline infectious peritonitis virus replication in vitro. Abstract The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-α), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidney-cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ∼17 μg ml−1 whereas the ID50 for FIPV was 2.5 μg ml−1. The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (⩾4 log10 reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1, the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN-α occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 μg ml−1. Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN-α and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1 to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN-α was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects. Potentially, synergistic combinations of the two antiviral agents in vivo may decrease the therapeutic dose of ribavirin required for inhibition of FIPV and thus reduce drug toxicity.',\n 'Development of protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy for detection of bovine coronavirus in calves: Comparison with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence of nasal epithelial cells. Abstract A protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (PAG-IEM) technique was developed for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4 4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2 4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and IF was 57%.',\n 'Seroepidemiology of Breda virus in cattle using ELISA. Abstract Two direct blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to Breda virus in sera of cattle were compared. An ELISA with consecutive addition of antigen and test serum to an antibody-coated plate gave higher positive: negative absorbence ratios than an ELISA in which antigen and test serum were added simultaneously. Sera collected from breeding and fattening herds in The Netherlands (n = 1313) and the F.R.G. (n = 716) were tested, and antibodies to Breda virus were demonstrated in 94% of adult cattle. Ninety percent of newborn calves had high levels of maternal antibodies, which waned until the age of 3 months. Active seroconversion occurred between 7 and 24 months in most animals.',\n 'Cultivation and partial characterization of bovine astrovirus. Abstract Bovine astrovirus serotype 2 (US2) was adapted to primary neonatal kidney cell (NBK) cultures by the addition of 50 μg ml−1 of trypsin in the medium. Infectious virus was released from the cells within 7 days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infections exceeded one. Occasionally 10–20% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3 9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.',\n 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus antibodies in swine sera. Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting serum antibodies to the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) was established by using cell culture-grown PEDV as antigen for coating. Ultracentrifugation through 20 and 45% (w/w) sucrose cushion proved to be the best antigen purification method. Examination of 1024 swine sera showed a high specificity and a greater sensitivity of the ELISA, when compared with indirect immunofluorescence. Reference sera with high antibody titers to PEDV originated from two pigs experimentally infected with PEDV. Three different antigen purification methods and the advantages of the ELISA compared with an immunofluorescence test are discussed.',\n 'A longitudinal study of bovine coronavirus enteric and respiratory infections in dairy calves in two herds in Ohio. Abstract This prospective longitudinal study examined the epidemiology and disease syndrome associated with bovine coronavirus (BCV) infections in a cohort of 8 conventional calves from 0 to 120 days of age, in two dairy herds in Ohio. The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24–48 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24–48 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.',\n 'Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.',\n 'Intestinal replication of a porcine respiratory coronavirus closely related antigenically to the enteric transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract One-week-old piglets were inoculated with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) either intravenously or directly into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Both inoculation routes resulted in the isolation of virus from the caudal small intestine. Viral replication, however, was only observed upon inoculation into the digestive tract in quantities of ≥ 103 TCID50. Replication remained limited to a few unidentified cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer at villus- or crypt-sites. Virus was excreted in the faeces for several days but infection of the respiratory tract occured rarely in the same pigs. The results of this study indicate that small changes in molecular structure between PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus have resulted in important changes in host cell tropism.',\n 'Contribution of molecular biology to the study of the porcine interferon system. Abstract We have performed molecular studies on the pig interferon (IFN) system (i) to analyse the role played by endogenous IFN in neonatal viral enteritis such as transmissible gastroenteritis and possibly to obtain, via recombinant DNA technology, a new anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agent in this species, (ii) to characterize the structure and biological functions of the IFN-like antiviral activity produced by the porcine embryo at the time implantation in the uterus. By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-α probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-α multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-α1 encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-α1 (methionyl IFN-α1). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN. After immunoaffinity purification to a specific activity of 5−10 × 107 International Units (IU)/mg of protein, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rIFN-α in the pig. These experiments revealed no major toxic effects in newborn (given 5 × 106IU/kg) or adult (1 × 106IU/kg) pigs. A significant pyrogenic effect (+ 1.5°C) was noted only in the adults.',\n 'Detection of avian infectious bronchitis viral infection using in situ hybridization and recombinant DNA. Abstract A recombinant DNA probe with specificity for the 3′ end of genomic RNA from the Ark 99 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was found to hybridize with extracted RNA of three strains with the Ark serotype, as well as the Mass41, Holl52, Gray, JMK, Conn, Fla and SE17 strains of IBV. Viral infection was detected in the cytoplasm of chicken embryo kidney cells inoculated with Mass41, Ark99, SE17 or two recent field isolates of IBV using in situ cytohybridization and a biotinylated probe. In vivo infections were detected in individual cells of tracheas and lungs 2, 4, and 6 days after inoculation of chicks with Mass41 and Ark99. In situ hybridization of Ark99 infected tissue sections using 32P-dATP labelled probe indicated that more viral replication was present in the trachea on day 4 than either days 2 or 6; whereas more viral RNA was found in the lungs on day 6 than days 2 or 4 after inoculation.',\n 'Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus in serum from cattle by dot blot hybridization assay. Abstract A dot blot hybridization assay was developed for use as a rapid screening test to detect bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in serum from infected cattle. A 1.1. kilobase cDNA, prepared from the BVDV genome, was molecularly cloned and used in this study. Insert cDNA was removed from the pUC9 plasmid vector by Pst-I restriction endonuclease digestion and purified from plasmid DNA by agarose electrophoresis and electroelution. The hybridization probe was prepared by nick translation in the presence of gamma dCT32P and labelled to a specific activity of 2 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA. Specificity was determined by dot blot hybridization of infected cell culture supernate from nine different BVDV strains. The probe hybridized equally with all strains of BVDV tested, which included four cytopathic and five noncytopathic strains of BVDV. Serum was collected from veal calves with respiratory tract disease, unthriftiness, anorexia, and/or poor conditions. Serum samples were treated with nonidet P40 detergent and denatured with formaldehyde and heat prior to application on 1.2 micron nylon membrane filters using a vacuum dot blot apparatus. Hybridization was done under relatively stringent conditions (50% formamide at 42°C). A total of 141 serum samples from different calves were tested and of these samples, 55 (39%) were positive by dot blot hybridization for BVDV RNA. Eight calves (33%) out of 24, tested 3 to 4 weeks later, remained positive for BVDV RNA.',\n 'Development of specific nucleic acid probes for the differentiation of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Abstract A dot blot hybridization assay is described for the detection and differentiation of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with 32P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the sensitivity and the capability of these probes to detect porcine field isolates of the same serotype.',\n 'Applications of nucleic acid probes in veterinary infectious diseases. Abstract Nucleic acid probe technology is increasingly being used in basic research in veterinary microbiology and in diagnosis of infectious diseases of veterinary importance. This review presents an overview of nucleic acid probe methodology and its applications in veterinary infectious diseases. The major applications of nucleic acid probes include detection of pathogens in clinical samples, especially those organisms which are fastidious and difficult to cultivate, differentiation of virulent from a virulent organisms and vaccine strains from wild type isolates, typing of microorganisms mapping genes, screening libraries of cloned DNA for specific genes, detection of latently infected or carrier animals, study of mechanisms of pathogenesis, epidemiological studies and food safety.',\n 'Induction of lactogenic immunity to transmissible gastroneteritis virus of swine using an attenuated coronavirus mutant able to survive in the physicochemical environment of the digestive tract. Abstract A trasmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus mutant (188-SG), selected as attenuated and resistant to acidity and proteases of the digestive tract of adult pigs, was used as vaccine (“Nouzilly strain”) in sows to protect suckling piglets against a challenge exposure carried out with a higly virulent TGEV strain. The pregnant sows were immunized once (42–49 days before farrowing) or twice (42–49 and 7–15 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of (1) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76. Moderate protection was observed in (1) the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36/90, (2) the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31/51. In contrast, improved protection was observed in (1) the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally, with piglet mortality of 23/95, (2) the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41, (3) the six sows experimentally infected with virulent TGEV with piglet mortality of 1/59. No correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets. The results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV is induced only by repeated ingestion of -SG attenuated 188-SG strain of TGEV.',\n 'The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems for serology and antigen detection in parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus infections in dogs in The Netherlands. Abstract Complex trapping blocking (CTB) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and rotavirus in sera of dogs were established. Double antibody sandwich ELISAs for the detection of CPV-, CCV- and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection ELISAs were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea. It was shown that the results of the respective serological ELISAs correlated well and that CPV was the major cause of virus-induced acute diarrhea in dogs in The Netherlands.',\n 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of canine coronavirus and its antibody in dogs. Abstract Two methods of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed for the diagnosis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection in dogs. One ELISA, in which CCV-infected CRFK cell lysate is used as antigen, is for the detection and titration of antibody against CCV, and the other ELISA uses the double antibody sandwich method for the detection of CCV antigen. The first ELISA procedure demonstrated antibody responses in dogs inoculated with CCV, as did the virus neutralization test; the second ELISA detected specific CCV antigen in feces and organ homogenates of inoculated dogs.',\n 'Perspectives on the epizootiology of feline enteric coronavirus and the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis. Abstract This review presents some current thoughts regarding teh epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses; feline infectious peritonisis virus (FIPV) and feline coronavirus (FEVC), with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature. Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.',\n 'Efficiency of various cloned DNA probes for detection of bovine viral diarrhea viruses. Abstract We have evaluated 24 cytopathic (CP) and 37 noncytopathic (NCP) strains of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) with a dot blot assay using four different genome segments of the NADL strain as hybridization probes (p80, p54, gp53, and gp62). The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 22 24 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 16 36 (43%) and 5 36 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 18 24 (75%) and the gp62 probe detected 19 24 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 9 37 (24%) and 7 37 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This low detecteion rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.',\n 'Antigenic analysis of feline coronaviruses with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs): Preparation of MAbs which discriminate between FIPV strain 79-1146 and FECV strain 79-1683. Abstract We prepared 31 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against either FIPV strain 79-1146 or FECV strain 79-1683, and tested them for reactivity with various coronaviruses by indirect flourescent antibody assay (IFA). Sixteen MAbs which reacted with all of the 11 strains of feline coronaviruses, also reacted with canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In many of them, the polypeptide specifity was the recognition of transmembrane (E1) protein of the virus. We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth). These MAbs also reacted with CCV or TGEV. These MAbs recognized peplomer (E2) glycoprotein, and many antigenic differences were found in this E2 protein. These results suggest that FIPV Type II and FECV Type II viruses are antigenically closer to TGEV or CCV than to FIPV Type I viruses. Furthermore, the MAb prepared in this study has enabled discrimination between FIPV strain 79-1146 and FECV strain 79-1683, which was thought to be impossible by the previous serological method.',\n 'Fixed-cell immunoperoxidase technique for the study of surface antigens induced by the coronavirus of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV). Abstract An immunoperoxidase technique performed on the TGEV-infected cells was developed for detection of virus-induced antigens. The presence of M antigen of TGEV on the surface of infected cells was demonstrated by this technique. This finding is in contrast to the M protein of murine hepatitis coronavirus which migrates to the Golgi apparatus but is not transported to the plasma membrane. The time course of appearance M and S antigens on the surface of TGEV-infected cell can be studied by this technique.',\n 'Homotypic and heterotypic serum and milk antibody to rotavirus in normal, infected and vaccinated horses. Abstract The homotypic and heterotypic antibody response to rotavirus was determined in three pony mares and their foals. The normal concentrations of anti-rotavirus antibodies in mares ‘milk and mares’ and foals′ serum over the first 10 weeks post-partum were measured using IgA, IgG and rotavirus sero-type-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Experimental infection of the foals with serotype 3 equine rotavirus produced a rapid, serotype-specific response which peaked 10 days after infection and a slower heterotypic response which peaked 32 days later. In contrast, vaccination of the mares with an inactivated, adjuvanted serotype 6 bovine rotavirus produced a heterotypic response similar to that of the homotypic response in both serum and milk, although the predominant response in serum was IgG, while in milk it was IgA. These results suggest that non serotype-restricted passive protection of foals against rotavirus may be achieved by parenteral vaccination of mares.',\n 'Detection of porcine rotavirus in stools by a latex agglutination test. Abstract We developed a simple agglutination test for the detection of porcine rotavirus in stools from pigs with diarrhea. The virus was detected with high sensitivity and specificity by a slide agglutination test using latex particles coated with antibody against the porcine rotavirus strain OSU (LA-antiOSU). The agglutination of LA-antiOSU with OSU on a glass slide evident macroscopically within 2 min. The sensitivity of this latex agglutination (LA) test was four times higher than that of the electron microscope method. The LA test is available for the rapid diagnosis of porcine rotavirus infections.',\n 'Interferon induction in porcine leukocytes with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract Leukocytes were harvested from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node and small intestinal lamina propria from groups of three piglets before, and 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at 2 weeks of age. The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-τ was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.',\n 'Immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of viral diseases: a review. Abstract Three immunopathological mechanisms may determine the pathogenesis of viral diseases in animals. (1) A variety of viruses causes transient or prolonged immunosuppression by infecting lymphoreticular tissues and interacting with components of the immune system. (2) In persistent viral infections effective immune responses may result in tissue damage. The mechanisms involved are T-cell-mediated destruction of infected cells and delayed-type hypersensitivity. (3) In a number of viral diseases pathogenic immune complexes are formed when antibodies are produced and react with viral antigen molecules persisting in the host. The selected examples of immune dysfunction are the focus of this review.',\n \"Antigen selection and presentation to protect against transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. Abstract The antigenic structure of the S glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) has been determined and correlated with the physical structure. Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus. These vectors, with a tropism for Peyer's patches may be ideal candidates in protection against TGEV.\",\n 'Animal immunodeficiency viruses. Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has morphological, physical and biochemical characteristics similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS in man. However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation. When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population.',\n 'Different stabilities to bile among feline calicivirus strains of respiratory and enteric origin. Abstract Feline calicivirus (FCV) strains isolated from feces (E-FCV) were compared with FCV strains of respiratory origin (R-FCV). All strains were shown to be labile at pH 3.0. All strains except one strain of E-FCV were found to be sensitive to the action of trypsin. When exposed to bile salt (deoxycholic acid sodium salt), all R-FCV strains were markedly inactivated, but none of the E-FCV strains was inactivated. It was possible to select bile-resistant substrains from a bile-sensitive strain.',\n 'An ELISA for detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) based on the specific solubility of the viral surface glycoprotein. Abstract Viral proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were extracted from the cytoplasm of infected Vero cells using hypotonic conditions and a non-ionic detergent. Both the pH and the NaCl concentration of the extraction buffer were varied in attempts to increase the solubility of the virion spike glycoproteins (S-protein) and of the nucleocapsid proteins (N-protein). Monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmune sera and convalescent pig sera were used to identify and monitor these proteins by immunoprecipitation and Western blots. The solubility of the S-protein was optimal at pH 4, whereas that of the N-protein was optimal at pH 9. Consequently, it was possible to enrich for either S-protein or N-protein; increases in the NaCl concentration of the buffer were of no advantage in this respect. Enriched preparations of the S-protein and N-protein were used as ELISA antigen for the S-ELISA and N-ELISA, respectively. The S-ELISA proved to be the more effective of the two immunoassays. Antibodies against S-protein remained detectable for longer periods of time than anti-N-protein antibodies in the sera of PEDV-infected pigs. Using this ELISA of increased sensitivity, it was observed that only a small number of farms in Switzerland had been infected with PEDV.',\n 'Detection of feline immunodeficiency proviral DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes by the polymerase chain reaction. Abstract Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.',\n 'Reduction in morbidity due to diarrhea in nursing beef calves by use of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted rotavirus — Escherichia coli vaccine in the dam. Abstract An outbreak of neonatal diarrhea occurred among beef calves (2000 animals) from one large Argentinian farm in 1985. Rotavirus was detected in 78% ( 106 136 ) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 1.5% of the samples ( 2 136 ) obtained from sick calves. In comparison rotavirus was identified in only 1.6% ( 1 63 ) of the samples from clinically healthy calves. The rotavirus strain responsible for the outbreak was characterized as serotype 6 belonging to group A. In the following three years the protective capacity of a combined rotavirus—E. coli inactivated vaccines administered to the dams during the last third of the gestation period was evaluated on this farm by comparison of morbidity due to diarrhea in calves from vaccinated vs. placebo cows within the same year. The morbidity due to diarrhea among calves from dams in the vaccinated and placebo groups was 34% and 77%, respectively in 1986; 23% and 47% in 1987, and 15% and 34%, in 1988. In 1987 morbidity of diarrhea in calves born from vaccinated heifers was 54% and 74% in calves from placebo heifers. In 1988 morbidity from diarrhea was 41% and 54%, respectively among calves in these two groups. In all experiments, calves from heifers showed significantly greater morbidity than calves from cows. Differences in diarrhea morbidity between the vaccinated and placebo groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Additional studies showed that the diarrhea had a significant influence (P<0.05) on the average live weight of the calves at weaning (5 to 7 months) with an average weight loss of 7.8 kg per calf among the calves affected with diarrhea.',\n 'Coronavirus infection in mink (Mustela vision). Serological evidence of infection with a coronavirus related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Abstract Antibodies to a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-related coronavirus have been demonstrated in mink sera by indirect immunofluorescence, peroxidase-linked antibody assays and immunoblotting. This is the first serological evidence of a specific coronavirus infection in mink. The putative mink coronavirus (MCV) seems to be widespread in the Danish mink population with a prevalence approaching 100%. Analysis by immunoblotting has shown that MCV is closely related to TGEV by the spike (S), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (N) polypeptides. Furthermore, antibodies to MCV also cross-reacted with N and M polypeptides of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thus MCV may occupy an intermediate position between the TGEV group of coronaviruses and PEDV. The possibility that MCV may be associated with syndromes of acute enteritis in preweaning mink is discussed.',\n 'Experimental infection of pigs with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV): measure of viral excretion. Abstract Twelve pigs were experimentally infected with a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) by the oronasal route. Viral excretion was measured daily by two means-deep nasal swabs and air samples obtained in a cyclone sampler. Clinical signs were very slight on infected pigs. Airborne virus could be recovered from day 1 to day 6 post-infection in the cyclone sampler as well as in petri dishes placed in the same loose-box. Viral titres obtained from nasal swabs were significantly correlated with those obtained from air samples. Different collection media were compared. The most efficient media for the collection of infectious viral particles contained a protective agent such as foetal calf serum.',\n 'In vitro properties and experimental pathogenic effect of three strains of feline immunodeficiency viruses (FIV) isolated from cats with terminal disease. Abstract Three strains of virus isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of sick cats were identified as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the basis of in vitro cytopathic effect, T-lymphotropism, ultrastructural morphology and magnesium-dependent reverse-transcriptase activity. The pathogenic properties of two isolates were studied in 13 experimentally infected cats. The primary phase of infection was characterised by a range of haematological (neutropenia, lymphopenia, presence of atrypical lymphocytes) and clinical alterations (fever, various signs lasting several weeks, generalised lymphadenopathy persisting for several months) and specific seroconversion. A correlation between the inoculated dose of virus and the intensity and duration of clinical signs was observed. The primary phase was followed in the 10 surviving cats by a stage of asymptomatic seropositivity of undetermined duration but which has persisted for over 35 months for the earliest infections. Viruses reisolated several weeks or months after experimental infection retained the same in vitro properties as the initial isolates.',\n 'Detection of feline infectious peritonitis virus infection in cell cultures and peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes of experimentally infected cats using a biotinylated cDNA probe. Abstract A dot blot hybridization assay, using a biotinylated cDNA probe, was able to detect feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) RNA in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells infected with the FIPV isolates DF2, 79-1146, UCDI, and UCD2. The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3′ three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling. Despite some cross-hybridization with FECV RNA, this probe should be useful for diagnosis of FIP, because cats infected with FECV most likely do not become viremic.',\n 'Coronavirus immunogens. Abstract Coronaviruses (CV) infect a variety of livestock, poultry and companion animals. They belong to at least five antigenic groups. CV cause localized infections of the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts, with the exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIVP) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (HEV) which cause systemic infections. The enteropathogenic CV infect the villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Several CV (bovine CV-BCV, porcine respiratory CV-PRCV, infectious bronchitis virus-IBV) cause respiratory disease. Current evidence indicates that protection against enteric and respiratory CV infections is mediated by passive or active immunity at the primary site of CV replication. Maternal vaccination approaches to induce passive immunity include the use of inactivated and modified live viral vaccines. Modified live viruses and a Ts mutant CV (FIPV) are also used as oral or intranasal vaccines to induce active mucosal immunity. The success of these vaccines in the field is often compromised by a number of potential problems. Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses, ranging from 80–160 nm in diameter and containing a positive-stranded RNA genome. They possess prominent surface spikes and some species display a fringe of smaller surface projections believed to be the hemagglutinin (HE). Coronaviruses possess 3 to 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein (150–200 kDa), the integral membrane glycoprotein (M; 20–30 kDa) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N; 43–50 kDa). A subset of CV (BCV, HEV, turkey CV) possess a third glycoprotein on the virion surface, the HE (60–65 kDa). These proteins can be quantitated using pooled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to distinct epitopes of each protein in ELISA. Most research has focused on the S protein as a candidate antigen for CV vaccines since it induces virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. However the HE protein stimulates the production of VN and HE inhibiting antibodies and the M protein induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement. Attempts to correlate in vitro VN antibody activity with in vivo protection have shown that the passive transfer of VN mAb to the S or HE protein conferred passive protection against CV challenge in some studies, but not others. Additional research has implicated a possible role for other CV proteins in immunity. Studies of mAb to the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) have provided evidence for a direct role of the M protein in the induction of αIFN by porcine blood leukocytes. The potential significance of this phenomenon to immunity to TGEV is unclear. Similarly, studies of IBV have suggested that determinants recognized by T cells reside on the N protein and these determinants may be shared among heterologous strains of IBV, resulting in the induction of cross-protection. Thus epitopes on the N protein may be important for induction of cell mediated immunity (CMI). CMI may play an important role in protection of cats against FIPV, since induction of circulating antibodies to the S protein of FIPV contributes to disease pathogenesis by the induction of immune complexes and antibody dependent enhancement of the infectivity of FIPV for macrophages. An increased understanding of antibody and CMI responses following natural CV infections in animals is needed to identify the antigens and epitopes that induce protective immune responses. The expression of CV structural protein genes in various vectors will provide the recombinant proteins needed for future immunogenicity studies in the host species. Furthermore, live rDNA vectors that replicate in the gut and express coronavirus genes may provide a new generation of coronavirus vaccines.',\n 'Survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd: comparison between polycrylamide gel electrophoresis and two commercial tests. Abstract A survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd with a history of neonatal diarrhoea was carried out. Faecal samples taken from 15 cows before and after calving as well as faeces taken from their calves daily from birth to two weeks of life were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and compared with an ELISA and a latex agglutination commercial test. Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8± 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3±1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P=0.0001) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period. Results obtained with both commercial kits closely paralleled each other and parameters other than sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy or predictive values have to be considered as selection criteria.',\n 'Immunization of pregnant gilts with PRCV induces lactogenic immunity for protection of nursing piglets from challenge with TGEV. Abstract The level of passive protection against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was evaluated by experimentally infecting 12 pregnant gilts with different doses of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and challenging their litters at 4 days of age. An overall survival rate of 70% was found for piglets nursing the 12 PRCV-infected gilts, compared to a 16% survival rate for piglets of nine uninfected control gilts. Six of the PRCV-infected gilts had adequate levels of immunity to resist infection with TGEV following the challenge of their litters. These six completely immuned gilts also solidly protected their litters from TGEV as shown by a 96% piglet survival rate through weaning at 3 weeks of age. The results suggest that respiratory infection with PRCV induces a substantial degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV.',\n 'Antigenic and biological diversity among transmissible gastroenteritis virus isolates of swine. Abstract Twenty-four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics. Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected cells from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test. These studies show that some biologic and antigenic diversity exists among TGEV isolates.',\n 'Binding of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus by enterocytes from newborn and weaned piglets. Abstract Enterocytes were harvested by chelation in a series of seven fractions from the tips of the villi to the crypts of the jejunum of newborn or weaned piglets. Binding of the low cell culture passaged Miller-6 strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to villous enterocytes from newborn piglets was at a high level, similar to that observed to culturedswine test is (ST) cells. Binding of the virus to cryptal enterocytes from newborn piglets or to villous or cryptal enterocytes from weaned piglets was significantly lower. In a competitive virus binding assay with radiolabelled virus, the binding of TGEV to ST cells was found to be saturable, while binding to MDBK cells, in which the virus fails to replicate, was at a lower level and was non-saturable. In the same assay, virus binding to the villous enterocytes from the jejunum of a newborn piglet was saturable, while binding to cryptal enterocytes from a newborn piglet, and to villous and cryptal enterocytes from a weaned piglet, was non-saturable. It was concluded that the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to TGEV infection, and the tropism of the virus for villous enterocytes, may relate to the presence of specific, saturable binding sites on the plasma membrane of villous enterocytes.',\n 'Inheritance of resistance to oedema disease in the pig: Experiments with an Escherichia coli strain expressing fimbriae 107. Abstract Inheritance of resistance to intestinal colonization with E. coli causing oedema disease is hypothetized to be under the control of one locus consisting of two alleles with susceptibility (S) dominating resistance (s). This mode of inheritance was investigated by matting pigs, resistant and susceptible to the disease, and examining the offspring. Weaned piglets were repeatedly inoculated orally with 5 × 105 CFU per pig per day of a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli serotype O139:K12(B):H1:F(107) and susceptibility determined by daily semiquantitative cultural examination of rectal swabs. Using results obtained from offspring. 5 boars were retrospectively assigned the genotype ss, 1 was assigned Ss, and 2 were assigned SS. Nine sows were designated ss, 8 classified Ss and 4 SS. Ninety two pigs resulted from matings regarded as ss×ss; 89 (97%) of these were resistant to colonization and oedema disease. Of the 168 pigs from Ss×ss matings, 83 (49%) were resistant, while only 13 (9%) of 146 pigs from matings with at least one SS parent were classified resistant. The results are compatible with inheritance being controlled by one locus and with susceptibility dominating resistance to oedema disease.',\n \"A review of feline infectious peritonitis virus: molecular biology, immunopathogenesis, clinical aspects, and vaccination. Abstract Feline infectious peritontis (FIP) has been an elusive and frustrating problem for veterinary practitioners and cat breeders for many years. Over the last several years, reports have begun to elucidate aspects of the molecular biology of the causal virus (FIPV). These papers complement a rapidly growing base of knowledge concerning the molecular organization and replication of coronaviruses in general. The fascinating immunopathogenesis of FIPV infection and the virus' interaction with macrophages has also been the subject of several recent papers. It is now clear that FIPV may be of interest to scientists other than veterinary virologists since its pathogenesis may provide a useful model system for other viruses whose infectivity is enhanced in the presence of virus-specific antibody. With these advances and the recent release of the first commercially-available FIPV vaccine, it is appropriate to review what is known about the organization and replication of coronaviruses and the pathogenesis of FIPV infection.\",\n 'Characteristics of vero cytotoxin producing Escherichia coli associated with intestinal colonization and diarrhea in calves. Abstract Isolates of Escherichia coli which produce Vero cytotoxin (VTEC) were obtained during 1983–1989 from calves raised in 5 north-central states of the USA. All of the calves experienced intestinal epithelial colonization by VTEC, diarrhea or both; twelve of the calves had bloody diarrhea. Twenty one isolates were serogroup O111 and the others were O103, O69, O45, O26, O5, or non-typable (4 isolates). All but one of the isolates hybridized with the CVD419 probe which identifies most VTEC strains. Thirty two isolates hybridized with the VT1 probe, 3 with both the VT1 and VT2 probes, and one with neither probe. The culture filtrate of the VT probe negative isolate was partially neutralized by SLT I monoclonal antibody. For the other isolates, the results of toxin neutralization by anti-SLT I and anti-SLT II monoclonal antibodies corresponded exactly with the VT1 and VT2 probe hybridization results. Three of the strains adhered in a localized manner to HEp-2 cells and Intestine 407 cells.',\n 'Cross-reactivity between B. burgdorferi and other spirochetes affects specificity of serotests for detection of antibodies to the Lyme disease agent in dogs. Abstract Western immunoblots, the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELA), and the microagglutination test were used to evaluate cross-reactivity among antibodies to serovars of Leptospira interrogans (leptospiral serovars), and B. burgdorferi from naturally infected dogs, and to Serpulina (Treponema) hyodysenteriae from vaccinated rabbits. Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Cross-reactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens. Antibodies to leptospiral serovars tended to cross-react more strongly with antigens of B. burgdorferi spp. than did antibodies to B. burgdorferi when tested against antigens of leptospiral serovars. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens of S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration. Conversely, dogs infected with the Lyme agent do not show significant cross-reactivity in the microagglutination test for antibody to the leptospiral serovars.',\n 'Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are encoded by the carboxyterminal portion of viral open reading frame 3. Abstract Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were revealed by serologic analysis of a recombinant protein derived from PRRSV open reading frame 3 (ORF 3). The hydrophilic carboxyterminal 199 amino acids encoded by the ORF 3 of a European (Lelystad) isolate of PRRSV were expressed as a recombinant fusion protein (BP03-P) in a baculovirus gene expression system. Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BP03-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BP03-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot. Despite a predicted potential for N-linked glycosylation, studies with tunicamycin and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) indicated that BP03-P was not N-glycosylated in either insect cell cultures or Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with the recombinant baculovirus. Sera from rabbits inoculated with BP03-P failed to neutralize both the European (Lelystad) and American (ATCC VR-2332) reference isolates of PRRSV and did not react by IPMA with PRRSV-infected cell cultures. Taken together, the data suggest that the carboxyterminal portion of PRRSV ORF 3 encodes a non-neutralizing viral peptide that is partially responsible for the serologic differences noted between European and most American isolates of PRRSV.',\n 'Antiviral action of interferon-alpha against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Abstract Swine testis (ST) cell cultures were treated with various doses of recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a (IFN), and assayed for 2′,5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (2–5 A synthetase) activity. Treatment with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN resulted in increased 2–5 A synthetase activity, but there was no significant response to 1 unit/ml of IFN. Titres of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were reduced between 6 and 15 hours post-infection in ST cells treated with 1000 or 2500 units/ml of IFN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysates of TGEV-infected ST cells, and of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-TGEV antibodies, revealed that the synthesis of the N and S proteins of TGEV was reduced in cells treated with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN. Viral RNA production, as determined with a probe which hybridized to the S gene of TGEV, was found to be reduced in ST cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN, but not in cells treated with 100 units/ml. It was concluded that, in IFN-treated ST cells, TGEV protein production may be decreased in the absence of reduced viral RNA production, and that 2–5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the antiviral activity of IFN against TGEV.',\n 'Antiviral activity of interferon against transmissible gastroenteritis virus in cell culture and ligated intestinal segments in neonatal pigs. Abstract Segments of jejunum in 5 to 6 days old piglets were surgically ligated, inoculated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and 18 hours later the segments were fixed for histology or suspensions were prepared for plaque assay in swine testis (ST) cell cultures to determine the yield of virus. When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes. The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon. When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-α or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-α2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum. It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically.',\n 'Serological and genotypic characterization of group a rotavirus reassortants from diarrheic calves born to dams vaccinated against rotavirus. Abstract Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.',\n 'Studies on the survival of canine coronavirus under different environmental conditions. Abstract Canine coronavirus (CCV) is a common faecal agent which is difficult to isolate. This study shows CCV to survive well at temperatures below −20°C but not at temperatures above 4°C. The presence of faecal material markedly reduced CCV survival times at temperatures ranging from 20°C to −70°C. Thus, it is suggested that diagnostic faecal material should be diluted 1:10 (w/v) with growth medium and examined at the earliest opportunity.',\n 'Detection of porcine respiratory coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was developed. A bovine TGEV-specific polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity chromatography with the TRIO Bioprocessing System and was used as the capture antibody, at a concentration of 1.5 μg/well. The F5.39 monoclonal antibody was obtained by the fusion of spleen lymphocytes from TGEV immunized mice with NS-1 myeloma cells. This mAb was used as a second antibody for the ELISA to detect TGEV in field cases, 53 intestinal samples were taken from pigs exhibiting clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis. All the positive samples detected by the ELISA were confirmed as positive by immunofluorescence or cell culture immunofluorescence. To study the ability of this ELISA to detect PRCV in nasal swabs and lung samples, 20 seven-day-old piglets were inoculated with a Quebec strain of PRCV. The ELISA was able to detect PRCV in both kinds of samples.',\n \"Detection of feline coronaviruses in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues using polymerase chain reaction. Abstract Feline coronavirus infections in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues were detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)_or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCID50 of FIPV 79-1146 (n = 10), FIPV UCD1 (n = 3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20–24°C) and 37°C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen (−70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test. Positive PCR results were obtained from the cell cultures that were inoculated with FIPV and FECV and from the FIPV-inoculated cats (13/13). Negative PCR results were obtained from the sham-inoculated cell cultures and cats (3/3). Of the 92 clinical cats, 7 of the 8 FIP-suspected cats (87.5%) and 51 of the 84 non-FIP-suspected cats (60.7%) were shown to be virus-positive in at least one of the tissue samples. There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P > 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin's solution- or ethanol-fixedtissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P < 0.01). In tissues that were kept at 4°C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 37°C, up to 24 h, respectively.\",\n 'Immunoblot studies in the differential diagnosis of porcine brucellosis: an immunodominant 62 kDa protein is related to the mycobacterial 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65). Abstract Smooth Brucella spp. share certain lipopolysaccharide antigens with other bacteria, resulting in serological cross-reactions which can prevent the definitive diagnosis of brucellosis. To identify other antigens with serodiagnostic potential, immunoblot studies following sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist. Sera from Y. enterocolitica 0:9 infected pigs, CFT reactor pigs (aetiology unknown), CFT negative pigs and hyperimmune pig serum raised to Y. enterocolitica 0:9 also recognized B. melitensis antigens, most notably a 17 kDa protein. This antigen appears to be a common cross-reactive protein.',\n 'Inhibitory effects of recombinant feline interferon on the replication of feline enteropathogenic viruses in vitro. Abstract Antiviral activities of a recombinant feline interferon (rFeIFN) KT-80 were evaluated against feline enteropathogenic viruses in feline and canine cell lines. Sensitivity to antiviral activities of the rFeIFN varied with cell types; Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells were more sensitive than Crandell feline kidney cells, but no sensitivity was found for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells when vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a challenge virus. Reductions were generally IFN dose-dependent and were more consistent when the cells were continuously treated with the rFeIFN than when they were pretreated only before viral challenge. Compared with each virus control culture of fcwf-4 cells, yields of rotavirus, feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus were reduced by ranges of 1.3 to ⩽3.1 log10, 0.6 log2, 0.8 to 3.7 log10 and 0.5 to 0.6 log10, respectively, in the cultures continuously treated with 10 to 10000 U of the rFeIFN. The yield reduction of FPLV was considered to be in part attributable to inhibition of cell growth by the rFeIFN supplemented in the medium.',\n 'More than one component of the Newcastle disease virus particle is capable of interferon induction. Abstract The interferon (IFN)-inducing capacities of intact NDV virions, β-propiolactone-inactivated particles and several structural components were compared, using human PBML as the IFN producing cells. Intact and inactivated virions as well as the nucleocapsid fraction did not differ significantly in their IFN-inducing capacity. In contrast, genomic RNA as well as M protein fraction and envelopes induced IFN titres to a level of about 10% of those achieved with virions. NDV-induced IFN production could be blocked specifically by incubation with polychonal anti-NDV-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and with two of three anti-HN-mAbs, but not with anti-NDV-mAbs directed against the F, M or NP protein. In addition, IFN induction by fixed MDBK cells, expressing NDV surface proteins after infection with NDV Ulster, was inhibited by one of two anti-F-mAbs. The results suggest that the induction of IFN synthesis in human PBML is a complex process involving not only the HN protein but also the uncleaved F protein precursor, a component of the M protein fraction and — once having entered the cell — the genomic RNA.',\n 'The neurobiology of canine distemper virus infection. Abstract Canine distemper virus (CDV) invades the nervous system and replicates in neurons and glial cell of the white matter during a period of severe viral induced immunosuppression. Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.',\n 'Control of canine distemper. Abstract Control of canine distemper can realistically only be achieved by the use of vaccination. The types of vaccine in current use are described, together with some of the problems encountered such as interference by maternal antibodies, and usage in species other than dogs. Modified live viral vaccines, as used for more than thirty years, have proved very effective. Nevertheless there is scope for some improvement in vaccine efficacy and recent developments in genetic recombinant methods are described.',\n 'Faecal viruses of dogs — an electron microscope study. Abstract Faecal samples from 112 dogs both with and without diarrhoea were screened for parvovirus by a haemagglutination titration test and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses and virus-like particles. On the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles were identified. Particles identified were coronaviruses, coronavirus-like particles, rotavirus-like particles, papovavirus-like particles, torovirus-like particles, picornavirus-like particles, 27 nm virus-like particles with projections and parvovirus-like particles which did not cause haemagglutination.',\n 'Shedding of “virus-like” particles in canine faeces. Abstract Diarrhoeic faeces from about 500 dogs were examined by negative stain electron microscopy. As well as parvovirus, and some of the other recognised viral causes of gastroenteritis, unusual “virus-like” particles were observed in about 8% of the samples. The particles were spherical, 100 nm to 300 nm in diameter, and surrounded by a thick wall penetrated by numerous pores. An additional 74 samples of normal faeces yielded no “virus-like” particles. We do not know the nature of these particles.',\n 'Antimicrobial activity of chicken and turkey heterophil peptides CHP1, CHP2, THP1, and THP3. Abstract Four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides (Chicken Heterophil Peptides 1 and 2, and Turkey Heterophil Peptides 1 and 3) were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens which are harbored by birds. At concentrations of 16-2 μg/ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of Candida albicans, Salmonella enteriditis, and Campylobacter jejuni. None of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of Pasteurella multocida by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration (16 μg/ml) tested. At 16 μ/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.',\n 'Characterization of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus S protein expression products in avirulent S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp: persistence, stability and immune response in swine. Abstract The spike protein from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was expressed in attenuated S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp Δasd χ3987. Three partially overlapping fragments of TGEV S gene, encoding the amino-terminal, intermediate, and carboxy-terminal end of the protein, as well as the full length gene were inserted into the asd + plasmid pYA292 to generate recombinant plasmids pYATS-1, pYATS-2, pYATS-3, and pYATS-4, respectively, which were transformed into S. typhimurium χ3987. Recombinant S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) and χ3987 (pYATS-4) expressing constitutively a 53 kDa amino-terminal fragment of the S protein and the full length protein (144 kDa), respectively, showed high stability. After 50 generations in vitro 60% and 20% of the bacteria transformed with pYATS-1 and pYATS-4, respectively, expressed the S-protein antigen. Since S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) showed a better level of expression and stability in vitro, this recombinant strain was selected as a potential bivalent vector to induce both immunity to Salmonella and TGEV in swine. In order to study colonization of swine tissues by S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp, a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin was cloned into the chromosome of S. typhimurium χ3987, generating χ4509 strain. Both S. typhimurium χ4509 (pYA292) and χ4509 (pYATS-1) colonized the ileum of orally inoculated swine with clearance of bacteria between days 10–20 post-infection. The expression of the amino-terminal fragment of the S protein diminished the ability of S. typhimurium χ4509 (pYATS-1) to colonize deep tissues. The recombinant strain S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and saliva of orally inoculated swine. This strain, as well as S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYA292), also elicited both systemic and mucosal immunity to Salmonella antigens.',\n 'Dual infections of feeder pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus followed by porcine respiratory coronavirus or swine influenza virus: a clinical and virological study. Abstract Dual infections of pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) followed by a second common respiratory virus, either porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SIV), were studied. The aim was to determine if dual infections, as compared to single virus infections, result in enhanced clinical manifestations. It was also examined if PRRSV replication affects replication of PRCV or SIV in the respiratory tract. Groups of conventional 10 week old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-only (3 pigs), PRCV-only (4 pigs) or SIV-only (4 pigs). Dual inoculations with PRRSV-PRCV (4 pigs) and PRRSV-SIV (3 groups of 4, 4 and 5 pigs) were performed at a 3 day interval. A group of uninoculated control pigs (8 pigs) was included. The infection with PRRSV-only induced a transient fever (40.2°C) at 2 DPI, but no respiratory signs. The PRCV-only infection remained subclinical. The SIV-only infection resulted in a one day fever (40.1°C) with moderate tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Mean weight gain in the virus-inoculated groups was retarded compared with the control group. The PRRSV-PRCV infection induced a 9 day lasting fever (peak 40.9°C) with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and productive coughing. The PRRSV-SIV infection resulted in fever and respiratory signs in all 3 groups. Clinical signs, however, were more pronounced in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Pigs of group 1 showed fever during 10 days (peak 41.4°C), tachypnoea, marked dyspnoea with abdominal breathing, and a productive cough. Pigs of groups 2 and 3 had fever for 5 and 3 days (peaks 40.6 and 40.3°C) respectively and mild respiratory disorders. Mean weight gain during 14 DPI of the 2nd virus was 5.9 kg in the PRRSV-PRCV group and 4.0, 6.8 and 6.7 kg in PRRSV-SIV groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean weight gain during the corresponding period in the PRRSV-only group was 8.6 kg. It was concluded that dual infections with viruses causes more severe disease and growth retardation than single PRRSV infection. PRCV excretion curves were similar in single and dual virus inoculated groups. Excretion of SIV was delayed by 2 days in the dual inoculated pigs. Thus, replication of the second virus is not (PRCV) or only slightly (SIV) affected by a prior infection with PRRSV.',\n 'Identification of bovine viral diarrhea virus receptor in different cell types. Abstract Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) have been used successfully in studies on bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) receptor(s) in our laboratory. The anti-ids specifically bound to cultured cells and identified a 50 kDa cellular membrane protein, which is thought to be a specific receptor for BVDV. In this study, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the anti-ids also specifically bound to different cell types, namely MDBK, EBK, BT, PK15, MA104, and Vero. Experiments on virus attachment and replication showed that BVDV adsorbed to all cells and replicated in them except monkey kidney cells MA104 and Vero (non-permissive). Results from plaque reduction assays indicated that cellular membrane proteins from all cell lines competitively inhibited BVDV attachment to cultured MDBK cells, suggesting the presence of BVDV receptor on all cells. Immunoblotting of cell membrane proteins with the anti-ids revealed a 50 kDa protein in both permissive and nonpermissive cells. Subcloned or synchronized MDBK cells demonstrated no significant difference of binding with anti-ids as compared to normal cultured cells.',\n 'There is nothing permanent except change. The emergence of new virus diseases. Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.',\n 'Feline calicivirus strain differentiation using monoclonal antibody analysis in an enzyme-linked immuno-flow-assay. Abstract Six monoclonal antibodies raised against feline calicivirus (FCV) strain F9 were used in an enzyme-linked immuno-flow-assay (ELIFA) to analyse 55 isolates of FCV. Forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease, chronic oral lesions, and from cats showing vaccine reactions, i.e. clinical signs of FCV infection shortly after vaccination. Eight reference strains including F9 and three vaccine strains based on F9 were also examined. All of the strains of F9, derived from various sources, reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies, whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any. In general, the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished. However, there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups. Overall, the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals, suggesting they were less related to F9. Although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to F9, none of the isolates reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies.',\n 'Protection of pigs by vaccination of pregnant sows against eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus. Abstract Serum-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum and colostrum of sows vaccinated during pregnancy with commercially available vaccines against eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV), and antibodies were detected in serum from nearly all pigs from vaccinated sows flllowing colostrum uptake. Serum-virus neutralizing antibody (SVN) test titers were measured in colostrum and pigs at the next farrowing, and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated SVN titers in serum, colostrum and all pigs. Six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 × 106 TCID50 EEEV did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed. Virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 × 104 TCID50, while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows. Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.',\n 'A germ-free status does not protect from the lethal effects of acute lung damage caused by o,s,s,-trimethyl phosphorodithioate. Abstract To investigate whether a normal resident microbiological flora of conventional rats influences the lethality of chemical-induced lung damage, the pneumotoxin O,S,S-trimethyl phosphorodithioate (OSSMe, 75 or 100 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to age-matched conventional and germ-free male F344 rats. Microbiological and serological examinations confirmed the germ-free state of the germ-free rats and showed that no specific lung pathogens were present in the conventional rats. As in conventional rats, clinical symptoms and death of OSSMe-treated germ-free rats resulted from respiratory failure. The germ-free rats were not more resistant, but rather more susceptible to OSSMe than conventional rats. Increases in lung weight and histological examination of lung tissue 3 days after dosing with OSSMe (75 mg/kg, s.c.) showed no differences between germ-free and conventional rats. Despite alterations in their nasopharyngeal flora, death in the conventional rats was probably not caused by bacterial superinfection. The higher susceptibility of germ-free rats to OSSMe can be partly attributed to pharmacokinetic differences, since plasma levels of OSSMe decreased more slowly in germ-free than in conventional rats. It is concluded that germ-free rats are not protected from the lethal consequences of acute chemical-induced lung damage.',\n 'Natural infection with bovine virus diarrhoea virus in a dairy herd: A spectrum of symptoms including early reproductive failure and retained placenta. Abstract The consequences of natural infections by bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in a dairy herd comprising approximately 60 cows were studied over a 3 year period. The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one still-birth, three calves that died within 1 week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) of non-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P < 0.001) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period. The gestational duration of multiparous cows (but not of heifers) was longer (P < 0.01) for five cows with PI calves (mean ± SD 287.6 ± 9.5 days) than for 53 other gestations in 35 cows (280.6 ± 3.8 days). Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P < 0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P < 0.01) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P < 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.',\n 'Chromatography of complex protein mixtures. Abstract This review has shown that a variety of chromatographic techniques are available for fractionating proteins. Fortunately, high-quality columns of every type described in this review are commercially available. Most water-soluble proteins may be eluted from size-exclusion, hydrophobic-interaction, ion-exchange, metal chelate, and bioaffinity columns with ease. When this is the case, high recovery and retention of biological activity are the norm. The exception is reversed-phase chromatography where the organic solvents and acids used in polypeptide elution denature many proteins. When problems do occur, they are generally the result of unique structural features of the protein. Very hydrophobic proteins have presented the biggest problem in that they are difficult to solubilize, particularly with retention of biological activity. It has been found that zwitterionic an non-ionic detergents are the most suitable solubilizing agents, but area has also been used in cases where hydrophobic interacts are not as strong. Unfortunately, there is still an element of trial-and-error in selecting the most suitable solubilizing agent. Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins also presents a problem. Both neutral and charged monosaccharides can be incorporated into proteins through multiple steps at several sites. Thus, there is the potential in a sample for a large number of glycoprotein species which have the same polypeptide backbone and differing amounts of oligosaccharide. A problem arises when size-exclusion, ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, reversed-phase and bioaffinity systems begin to discriminate between these very similar glycoprotein species. Chromatographic peaks can become very load, due to incomplete fractionation, and the polypeptide chain of interest can be associated with multiple peaks. The separation of glycoproteins requires much more study before logical procedures can be suggested for column selection and operation. Aggregated species are another class of proteins which present occasional problems. Multimeric proteins are adsorbed to sorbents by a series of forces, among which are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These forces are also responsible for the maintenance of quaternary structure in proteins. When the same forces dominate both retention of protein structure and adsorption at the sorbent surface, the quaternary structure of the protein can be disrupted during elution. Very basic proteins also present a problem in some cases. Columns with residual negative charges, such as a silica-based reversed-phase column, adsorb anionic species so strongly that they are difficult to elute. This is the case with ribosomal and nucleoproteins. The solution is to use exhaustively end-capped columns which diminish electrostatic interactions.',\n 'Column liquid chromatography of integral membrane proteins. Abstract Biological membranes have as a major function the compartmentation of biological processes in cells and organelles. They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded. These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than average hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent. RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD.',\n 'Peptide and protein drugs: II. Non-parenteral routes of delivery. Abstract In this second part of a two-part review, the absorption and delivery of peptide and protein drugs via non-parenteral routes are discussed. Approaches considered include the absorption enhancers, iontophoretic methods, the use of absorption inhibitors and prod rugs.',\n 'Antiviral screening of British Columbian medicinal plants. Abstract One hundred methanolic plant extracts were screened for antiviral activity against seven viruses. Twelve extracts were found to have antiviral activity at the non-cytotoxic concentrations tested. The extracts of Rosa nutkana and Amelanchier alnifolia, both members of the Rosaceae, were very active against an enteric coronavirus. A root extract of another member of the Rosaceae, Potentilla arguta, completely inhibited respiratory syncytial virus. A Sambucus racemosa branch tip extract was also very active against respiratory syncytial virus while the inner bark extract of Oplopanax horridus partially inhibited this virus. An extract of Ipomopsis aggregata demonstrated very good activity against parainfluenza virus type 3. A Lomatium dissectum root extract completely inhibited the cytopathic effects of rotavirus. In addition to these, extracts prepared from the following plants exhibited antiviral activity against herpesvirus type 1: Cardamine angulata, Conocephalum conicum, Lysichiton americanum, Polypodium glycyrrhiza and Verbascum thapsus.',\n 'Within-and between-strain variability in longevity of inbred and outbred rats under the same environmental conditions. Abstract The analysis of 26 longevity curves of different populations of inbred (Fischer 344) and outbred (Sprague-Dawley) rats highlighted a remarkable between-populations variability in survival parameters. This variability is independent of the breeding characteristics of the strain. The two strains differed in the slope of the survival curves, with Fischer 344 rats showing a higher survival over the second year of life as well as a lower interindividual variability. A model-free approach based on principal component analysis allowed us to quantify these differences and to highlight some limitations of the classical Gompertzian approach.',\n 'An eight-year study of the viral agents of acute gastroenteritis in humans: Ultrastructural observations and seasonal distribution with a major emphasis on coronavirus-like particles. Abstract During an 8-yr period, 862 stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.5). Forty-one percent of the specimens submitted over an 8-yr period were determined to be positive for virus or viruslike particles belonging to one or more of seven morphologically distinct viral groups. Coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) were present in 69.8% of the positive stool specimens. Membranous profiles containing “complement-type” holes (10 nm in diameter) were identified in some preparations containing CVLPs. The second most prevalent viral agent found in stool specimens was the rotavirus (17% of all positive stools). The incidence of other viruses identified in the survey were as follows: adenovirus 4.5%, picorna/parvovirus agents 2.9%, Norwalk-like agent 2.9%, astrovirus 1.9%, and calicivirus 0.5%. Unclassified small round viruses (≈25–30 nm in diameter) represented 0.5%. It was also determined that there was a seasonal distribution in excretion of all viruses except for CVLPs. A greater number of viruses were identified in the cooler, drier months of the year.',\n 'Comparison of detection methods for adenovirus from enteric clinical specimens. Abstract Fecal samples submitted for virus examination over July 1990 to June 1991 from children <3 years of age were examined by electron microscopy (EM), virus culture (VC), and enzyme immunoassay [EIA, group-reactive and adenovirus (Ad) 40/41 specific; Cambridge BioScience] to compare the detection rate of adenovirus from pediatric fecal specimens. Ad isolates of serotypes 1–7 grown in HEp-2 or primary rhesus monkey kidney cells were identified by neutralization. Graham 293 cell cultures were used only when specimens were found to be positive for Ad by EM, type-specific Ad40/41 EIA, and for isolates not identified by neutralization. Ads grown in 293 cells were identified by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Of the 1187 specimens examined, 105 (9%) were found to be positive for Ad. VC detected 93, while 12 additional positives were detected by EM or EIA. The relative sensitivity of VC, EIA, and EM for the 105 specimens was 89% (93), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively. Among the 105 positive specimens, enteric Ad, nonenteric Ad, and untypeable Ad were 28% (29), 65% (68), and 7% (8), respectively. Of 37 EM positives, 62% (23) were enteric Ad; 27% (10) were nonenteric including serotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 31, with 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1 isolates of each type positive, respectively; and 11% (4) were detectable only by EM. Five isolates were identified as variant of Ad 2(3), Ad 3(1) and Ad 31(1). Over a 1-year period, a single Ad41 variant strain was the most frequently detected enteric Ad in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. For maximum detection rates of Ad viruses in pediatric fecal specimens, a combination of EM, VC, and EIA is required, but group-reactive EIA, or EM followed by Ad40/41-specific EIA of initial positives, are the most direct and efficient methods for enteric Ad detection.',\n 'Synthesis of long cDNA from viral RNA template. Abstract Methods to make long and reliable cDNA from viral RNA template have been optimized. The conditions of the denaturation of the viral RNA template were most critical. For synthesis of the first DNA strand, the concentration of the primer and the presence of an RNase inhibitor were important. During the synthesis of the second strand, the incubation temperature was found to have effect on the length of the transcripts. Application of our optimized conditions on coronaviral genomic RNA as template resulted in cDNA libraries with inserts in the range of 0.5–5 kb without a separate cDNA size selection. Furthermore, a convenient variant of the alcohol precipitation and the analysis of single-stranded DNA on neutral agarose gels are described.',\n 'Adult and pediatric pharyngitis: A review. Abstract Acute pharyngitis is frequently encountered in the ambulatory care setting. Although usually of viral etiology, streptococcal disease is the focus of diagnostic efforts, in light of significant suppurative and nonsuppurative sequelae. The traditional symptoms of fever, adenopathy, and pharyngeal exudate are suggestive, but not diagnostic of streptococcal pharyngitis. Thus, the importance of diagnostic testing, including Group A beta hemolytic strep antigen screen and culture, is emphasized. Recent innovations in therapy include modification of antibiotic dosing regimens and use of cephalosporins to improve patient compliance.',\n 'Requirements for schwann cell migration within cns environments: A viewpoint. Abstract Schwann cells are able to migrate into the CNS and myelinate CNS axons in a number of developmental and pathological situations. Morphological studies based on normal, mutant and experimentally-lesioned tissue have indicated that Schwann cells are only able to enter the CNS when the integrity of the astrocytic glia limitans is disrupted. The significance and subtlety of the interactions between Schwann cells and astrocytes have been further explored by glial cell transplantation studies. These studies support in vitro observations on Schwann cell behaviour in highlighting the importance of extracellular matrix for both migration and myelin sheath formation. The failure of Schwann cells to intermix with astrocytes is an important aspect of glial cell biology which will have a bearing on efforts to remyelinate demyelinated axons by Schwann cell-transplantation.',\n 'Cytokine network in the central nervous system and its roles in growth and differentiation of glial and neuronal cells. Abstract Cells resident within the central nervous system (CNS) can synthesize, secrete and respond to inflammatory cytokines not only contributing to the responses to injury or immunological challenge within the CNS, but also regulating their own growth and differentiation potential. The actions and cell communication via cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network, in which microglia and astrocytes play the central roles. To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF β, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network. Finally, we investigated that expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors in neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. From these results, we discussed the features of the CNS cytokine network.',\n \"Virus-like particles with T = 19 icosahedral symmetry in a human gastroenteritis stool. Abstract Virus-like particles not previously described were observed in a human gastroenteritis stool using negative-stain TEM. The stool was among a number of acute-phase illness stools which had been collected in Egypt during 1980. The particles measured 65–70 nm in diameter, and it was possible to detect individual capsomeres on many of these particles. The capsomeric pattern identified on the particles corresponded to an icosahedrally symmetric T = 19 capsid. Distinctive five-fold vertices, usually appearing as darker spots on the capsid, were an additional feature of these particles. The capsid structure, which is skew, could readily be distinguished from the T = 25 capsid of adenovirus and the holey capsids of rotavirus and reovirus. Antibody to the particles was detected in both the shedding individual's acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens using IEM, although an antibody increase was not demonstrated.\",\n 'Negative staining in the detection of viruses in clinical specimens. Abstract Viruses have unique morphology and are therefore good candidates for negative staining. Negative staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) or uranyl acetate has facilitated the detection of many viruses in clinical specimens. Enhancement procedures have included the use of centrifugation and agar diffusion for concentrating virus particles, the use of solid phase capture reagents to trap virus particles and the use of secondary antibodies and electron dense markers to help visualize them. Techniques currently in use and employing negative staining include direct EM, immune electron microscopy (IEM), solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), colloidal gold-labeled protein A (PAG), solid phase IEM employing a second decorator antibody (SPIEMDAT), and solid phase IEM using colloided gold-labeled secondary antibodies (SPEIMDAGT). IEM methods assist with the detection of small viruses or viruses present in low numbers while PAG offers increased sensitivity over direct EM and IEM. In our experience the serum-in-agar (SIA) method is the most sensitive of the PAG IEM techniques for detection of rotavirus particles in clinical specimens. SPIEMDAT enhances the detection of small viruses which are often missed by other techniques due to background staining in specimens. SPEIMDAGT employing colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody has increased sensitivity and offers the advantage of detecting viral antigen when whole virus particles are not visible. IEM techniques have recently been used for typing viruses using either monospecific antisera or monoclonal antibodies and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody.',\n 'AIDS, alcohol, endothelium, and immunity. Abstract Analogies are drawn between important unknowns in AIDS and alcohol research, related to underlying common pathogenetic mechanisms, immunodysregulation, cofactors, and prominent vascular manifestations. The central role of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures and specifically their endothelial lining in many facets of the immune response is reviewed. Evidence is presented that both alcohol and HIV (as well as other coinfecting viruses in AIDS) target and alter endothelial cells and the angiogenic process. These concepts are further illustrated by a serendipitous viral epidemic among rats on continuous long-term alcoholic and control nonalcoholic diets, where synergism between alcohol and virus appeared to underlie multiple vascular proliferative lesions in the liver. In AIDS and alcoholism/alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the prominent features of dysregulated angiogenesis point to the endothelium as a key player in pathogenesis of these seemingly disparate disorders and potentially in immunomodulation.',\n 'Haemagglutination by mouse hepatitis virus type 3. Abstract Partially purified preparations of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) agglutinated fowl, day-old chick, ferret, hamster and human O erythrocytes at 4, 20 and 37°C and mouse erythrocytes at° C.',\n 'Regulation of viral persistence in human glioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells infected with coronavirus OC43. Abstract Cultures of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human glioblastoma (U87-MG) were compared for their ability to sustain a persistent infection with coronavirus OC43. Within 28 days, infectious virus and hemagglutinin were being produced at high levels in both types of cells. Temperature sensitive plaque variants were recovered at 31 °C. In both cell types, the virus caused increased antigen synthesis and cell death, if the temperature was lowered to 31 °C. Infectious virus was lost if cells were treated with antiserum to whole virus or if the temperature was raised to 39.5 °C. Probing the cured cells with OC43-specific 32P-cDNA showed that cured cells contained no detectable viral RNA. The relative ease of establishment and cure of these persistent infectious makes them attractive as models to study coronavirus regulatory processes.',\n 'Late onset, symptomatic, demyelinating encephalomyelitis in mice infected with MHV-JHM in the presence of maternal antibody. Abstract The presence of maternal antibodies protected suckling C57BL/6 mice from the clinical manifestations of the acute encephalomyelitis caused by mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a coronavirus, even though histological evidence of encephalomyelitis was found at early times after inoculation. 100% of infected suckling mice developed a fatal disease in the absence of maternal antibody. By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination. At 3–8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting. Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem. The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis. MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis. These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease. This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination.',\n 'Experimental demyelination induced by coronavirus JHM (MHV-4): molecular identification of a viral determinant of paralytic disease. Abstract The molecular basis for demyelination induced by the neurotropic murine coronavirus JHM (JHMV or MHV4) is unknown. We have attempted to explore this issue by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for the major JHMV glycoprotein (E2) to select sets of neutralization resistant (NR) antigenic variant viruses. Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 bind to topographically distinct sites on E2. NR variants selected with J.7.2, like parental JHMV, predominantly cause a fatal encephalitis when given intracerebrally to mice, while J.2.2-selected NR variants cause a subacute disease characterized by paralysis and severe demyelination. We report here that consecutive selection with both J.2.2 and J.7.2 monoclonal antibodies results in NR variants which are markedly attenuated in both encephalitic potential and ability to induce demyelination. Analysis of the different variants suggests that the subregion of E2 bound by monoclonal antibody J.7.2 may be a critical viral determinant of paralysis and demyelination in this model system.',\n 'The astrocyte is a target cell in mice persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM. Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes a late onset, clinically apparent, demyelinating encephalomyelitis in 40% of suckling C57BL/6 mice born to immunized dams. Suckling mice born to unimmunized dams rapidly succumb to an acute encephalomyelitis. MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic. To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes.2 The results indicate that 20% (range 0–52%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes. In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes. These results indicate that astrocytes are a target cell in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice persistently infected with MHV-JHM, and suggest that the astrocyte is a potential cellular reservoir for MHV-JHM in asymptomatic mice.',\n 'Coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 causes a persistent, productive infection in primary glial cell cultures. Abstract MHV-A59 causes a chronic demyelinating disease in mice which is accompanied by persistence of viral genome in white matter. As part of the investigation into the mechanism of viral persistence, infection of glial cells, probable targets for chronic infection, was studied by the use of mixed glial, enriched oligodendrocyte and enriched astrocyte cultures. Following MHV-A59 infection in vitro, approximately 10% of oligodendrocytes and 30% of astrocytes expressed viral antigens in the absence of overt cytopathic effect. All cultures released infectious virus for the lifetime of the cultures, for at least 45 days in the case of mixed glial cultures. Cultures derived from previously infected mice were similar to those infected in vitro with respect to percentage of cells expressing viral antigen and levels of infectious virus produced. These results show (1) that glial cells are early sites of infection in vivo as well as sites of infection in in vitro cultures, and (2) that glial cells support a non-lytic but productive infection in vitro and thus may contribute to viral persistence in vivo.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating disease. XVII. The infectious process in athymic rats inoculated with JHM virus. Abstract Wistar Lewis (WL), Long Evans (LE) and other rat strains develop complete resistance to CNS disease when inoculated intracerebrally with murine hepatitis JHM virus (JHMV) after the 10th day of age. 1 1 Sorensen O, Percy D, Dales S. In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases. III. JHM virus infection of rats. Arch Neurol 1980; 37: 478-84. Two types of studies were conducted to ascertain the involvement of the cellular immune system in development of resistance. Immunosuppression of WL rats with cyclosporin A (CsA) following onset of the age-related resistance demonstrated that this drug was partially able to abrogate resistance. In the other studies nude (rnu/rnu) rats, their heterozygous (rnu/+) litter mates and genetically related LE rats of various ages were challenged with JHMV. The rnu/+ and LE animals became completely resistant before the age of weaning, whereas some rnu/rnu rats, challenged as late as 70 days of age, showed disease symptoms—albeit after a long latent period. These observations indicated that the cellular immune system plays an important role in suppressing the disease process in the CNS. When the infection of nude rats was initiated on or after the 15th day of life, the histological lesions were generally small and present in both grey and white matter but were seldom seen in the spinal cord. Mononuclear infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS. In some nude rats there was massive mononuclear cell infiltration towards the meningies and into ventricular spaces. By contrast in rnu/+, LE and WL rats with late-onset disease symptoms, demyelinating-type lesions were confined to the white matter and only minor infiltration of mononuclear cells was evident. JHMV RNA was detectable by dot-blotting analysis in the CNS of both paralysed and asymptomatic rnu/rnu and rnu/+ rats, but less RNA was usually detected in heterozygous animals. In-situ hybridization with cDNA probes for JHMV RNA showed that neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cells in the white matter, were frequently infected. The present data indicate that in the rat T cells have an important function in maintaining resistance to the JHMV related disease process. However, even without a functional T cell compartment nude rats challenged after 15 days of age did not develop an acute encephalitis, suggesting that an age-dependent, non-immunological mechanism is also involved in restricting the spread of infection. It is possible that resistance in euthymic rats sets in because: (1) at the time of weaning the CNS matures, so that the number of targets available for infection is reduced, (2) T cells prevent the late-onset disease by clearing persistent, low grade infections from the CNS.',\n 'A bacterial pathogenicity determinant associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. Abstract Predominant enterobacteria from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were examined for an unusual ability to ferment lactose. One such isolate, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, was partially induced for lactose operon expression in tryptone containing media, and was also pathogenic in a rabbit ileal loop model for NEC. A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model. The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned. The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain. A K. pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model. These results and previous studies on the intraluminal biochemistry of infants with NEC support the hypothesis that an increased ability for lactose fermentation may be a bacterial pathogenic trait with respect to NEC.',\n 'In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases XXIV. The infectious process in cyclosporin A treated Wistar Lewis rats inoculated with JHM virus. Abstract In the present study we investigated age related effects of inoculum size and cellular immunity on the CNS disease caused by JHM virus (JHMV) in Wistar Lewis (WL) rats. Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 106 pfu or less. The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance. However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV. The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats. Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile. The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent. From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system. When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent.',\n 'Modulation of resistance to Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Abstract Prior infection of mice with a field strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) increased the early resistance of euthymic mice to virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SR-11 infections (as defined by significantly fewer salmonella colony-forming units (cfu) present in spleens and livers 4 days after salmonella infection). This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty s (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty r (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps d nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection. Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella. These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens.',\n 'Growth of canine distemper virus in cultured astrocytes: relationship to in vivo persistence and disease. Abstract Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes an encephalomyelitis in dogs which varies with the viral strain. The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (± 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.',\n 'Relapsing encephalomyelitis following transfer of partial immunity to JHM virus. Abstract Mice infected with the JHM strain mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) develop a fatal encephalomyelitis with evidence of demyelination. It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5 × 107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1 × 107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h. Resolution of disease correlates with a selective and permanent suppression of the JHMV-specific DTH reactivity. In addition, no virus-specific DTH is detected following adoptive transfer of viral-specific DTH effectors derived from immunized donors. In contrast, these mice respond to a heterologous antigen, KLH, suggesting that the resolution of the encephalitis is accompanied by a profound suppression in viral-specific DTH response.',\n \"Role of T cells in resistance to Theiler's virus infection. Abstract Intracerebral infection of C57BL/10SNJ mice with Theiler's virus results in acute encephalitis with subsequent virus clearance and absence of spinal cord demyelination. In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4+ (class II-restricted) or CD8+ (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice. However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response.\",\n 'Mouse hepatitis virus A59 increases steady-state levels of MHC mRNAs in primary glial cell cultures and in the murine central nervous system. Abstract Infection of mixed glial cell cultures with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 results in an approximately six-fold increase in the level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I mRNA. In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.',\n \"SJL/J resistance to mouse hepatitis virus-JHM-induced neurologic disease can be partially overcome by viral variants of S and host immunosuppression. Abstract The basis of the resistance of SJL/J mice to various strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been the subject of some debate, especially as it relates to the number and nature of the determinants involved. Our previous work demonstrated that resistance by primary SJL/J glial cultures may involve events subsequent to viral gene expression, possibly due to a defect in cell-to-cell spread of the infection. Since S, the virion's major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells. Variants possessing deletions within the S coding region were able to grow in SJL/J glial cells 10–100 times easier and fuse five-times more efficiently than wt virus. Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.\",\n 'Acute and late disease induced by murine coronavirus, strain JHM, in a series of recombinant inbred strains between BALB/cHeA and STS/A mice. Abstract To examine the genetic control of acute and late disease induced by a murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV), BALB/cHeA, STS/A, F1 hybrids and 13 recombinant inbred (RI) strains between BALB/cHeA and STS/A mouse strains were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 pfu of JHMV. All the BALB/cHeA mice died within 2 weeks from acute encephalitis. In contrast, STS/A mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of viral production. The mortality rates, survival times and viral titers of F1 hybrids and the RI strains varied, suggesting involvement of multiple genes. STS/A, F1 hybrid and RI mice surviving the acute infection occasionally developed severe paraparesis about 1 month post-infection. In these mice, vacuolar degeneration, astrocytosis, the absence of perivascular cuffing and minimal demyelination were found in the central nervous system. No infectious virus could be recovered from these mice. Although the paralysis of delayed onset was limited to STS/A, F1 hybrid and eight of the 13 RI strains, the incidence varied significantly among the RI strains. These results may suggest that JHMV-induced late disease is also under multifactorial control. The pathogenesis of JHMV infection is discussed.',\n 'Effect of diethylcarbamazine on testing serum samples for retroviral antibodies. Abstract Previous investigations have revealed that in vivo use of diethylcarbamazine (N,N-diethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazine carboxamide; DEC), the mainstay of prevention and therapy for filariases, results in increased titers of antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) in feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected cats.In the present study, the effect of in vitro DEC on detection of serum antibodies to retroviruses was investigated. The addition of DEC (5 mg ml−1, pH 7·3–7·4) to the serum diluent resulted in detection of antibody to FOCMA by indirect membrane immunofluorescence in five of five FeLV-infected cats, whereas samples from all five cats tested negative without the addition of DEC. In vitro DEC also increased the absorbance values generated by enzyme immunoassay human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody testing of samples from (a) persons with AIDS-related disease; (b) persons with helper T-lymphocytes < 500 mm−3 blood; and (c) persons testing positive for antibody to HIV-1 env- but not gag-related antigens as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( RIP-SDS PAGE ). We conclude that in vitro as well as in vivo use of DEC may alter results of antibody testing for retroviruses.',\n 'Viral infections of the respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis. Abstract The role of viruses and bacteria in the development of respiratory tract infections causing acute deteriorations in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was investigated. Over a period of 30 months, 29 viral respiratory diseases were proven serologically by testing 275 sporadically collected sera from 75 patients with cystic fibrosis. The influenza A virus was the most frequent responsible viral pathogen (11 × ), followed by adenovirus (8 × ), influenza B virus (5 × ), parainfluenza virus type 3 (3 × ), parainfluenza virus type 1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (each of 1 × ). There was no serological evidence for infections with parainfluenza virus type 2, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Coxiella burnetii. Deterioration of the clinical condition was found in 78% of the viral infections leading in 70% to hospital admission. Patients with cystic fibrosis and viral respiratory illnesses showed significantly more admissions to the hospital (3·2 ± 2·7) with a longer stay (90·6 ± 99·6 days). Nearly all viral episodes (93%) were accompanied or followed by a significant change of the microbial flora in the sputum especially by colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventy-two per cent of the viral infections occurred at home and 28% seemed to be hospital acquired. Our study emphasises the importance of improving antibacterial therapy at home to reduce the number of hospital admissions. Efforts for prophylaxis by vaccination or the use of chemotherapeutic agents should be made for the patients with cystic fibrosis.',\n 'Comparison of six commercial kits for the diagnosis of rotavirus infection in man and calves. Abstract Seventy-two human and 72 bovine faecal specimens were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), four commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Rotascreen, Wellcozyme, Rotazyme II and IDEIA) and two latex agglutination (LA) kits (RotaScreen and Wellcome). Specimens which were negative by PAGE but positive by one or more of the kits were further examined by direct and immuno-electron microscopy (DEM and IEM). If also negative by DEM and IEM the kit result was considered to be a false positive. Three kits (RotaScreen and IDEIA ELISAs and RotaScreen LA) had specificity and sensitivity greater than 90% on the human specimens but only two (RotaScreen ELISA and LA) had specificity and sensitivity over 80% on the bovine specimens. These kits can therefore be used with reasonable confidence for rotavirus diagnosis, but none of them has any advantage over PAGE other tha speed.',\n 'Detection of adenoviruses in faeces and the confirmation of isolates by latex agglutination. Abstract An adenovirus (AV) group-specific latex agglutination test (LA) was assessed for its ability to detect AVs in faeces and to confirm the isolation of AVs in cell culture. It detected all of 62 strains belonging to subgenus F (AdF) but only 4 40 non-AdF serotypes. This is possibly due to the concentration of AdF strains in faeces being greater than non-AdF strains. No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated. All of 14 AV isolates but none of the 12 isolates of other viruses were LA positive. It is concluded that LA would be useful for detecting AdF strain in faeces and for confirmation of AV isolates, especially if electron microscopic facilities were not available.',\n 'Origin of the human L1 elements: Proposed progenitor genes deduced from a consensus DNA sequence. Abstract A consensus sequence for the human long interspersed repeated DNA element, L1H8 (LINE or KpnI sequence), is presented. The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.',\n 'Biotinylated and radioactive cDNA probes in the detection by hybridization of bovine enteric coronavirus. Abstract cDNA, synthesized on bovine coronavirus (BCV) genomic RNA templates, could be used to detect very small quantities (i.e. 1 pg) of viral RNA by hybridization with either radioisotopic-labelled or biotinylated recombinant plasmids. Virus was optimally attached to nitrocellulose membranes when spotted in 1 × SSC, whereas 20 × SSC was superior for viral RNA. Denaturation and RNA fixation of both RNA, still encapsidated in virus particles and isolated genomic RNA, was achieved by baking of the blots in vacuum. Virus detection in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells was feasible, but improved significantly after proteinase K treatment. No homology was observed between virus cDNA with either plasmid DNA or nucleic acid isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells. Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe. Significant detection amplification (30–50 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19. A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences. Although the detectability was surpassed by biotinylated probes, sensitivity was superior in radioisotopic virus detection.',\n 'Detection of bovine enteric coronavirus in clinical specimens by hybridization with cDNA probes. Abstract Molecular hybridization, previously optimized for purified bovine coronavirus (BCV), was adapted for detection of virus in clinical specimens. For this purpose, the accuracy of the existing tests had to be improved and suitable means for removal of extraneous molecules had to be established. Six radioactive probes were used to obtain adequate detection signals. These probes, containing the complete N and E1 gene sequences and other sequences, hybridized to about 1 4 of the total length of the viral RNA. Genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior Freo-nextraction or centrifugation of specimens on a cushion of sucrose improved considerably the positive identification of virus containing samples. RNA detection in positive clinical specimens was significantly better by hybridization than immunological detection of BCV by ELISA, although differences were slight after two passages of the virus on HRT-18 cell monolayers. Consequently, the reliability of positive and negative test results in hybridization tests on Freon extracted specimens was better than in ELISA. However, results after extraction with other organic solvents were inferior. The accuracy of ELISA was surpassed by hybridization assays. Background signals, due to vector homology were found to be negligible in all the samples analyzed.',\n 'Mapping neuroinvasiveness of the herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis-inducing strain 2762 by the use of monoclonal antibodies. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE were employed in an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness using sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively. The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice. We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.',\n 'Immunohistochemical and behaviour pharmacological analysis of rats inoculated intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. Abstract A temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus was inoculated intranasally into infant Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 to 17 days. Rats receiving the virus at 9 days of age had an extensive spread of infection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day 11 postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67 ± 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Double-labelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine- and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightly reduced.',\n 'Expression of nitric oxide synthase type II in the spinal cord under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia. Abstract There is evidence supporting spinal cord nitric oxide (NO) production in the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia, presumed to arise from the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS I). Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.',\n 'Effects of 3,3′-iminodipropionitrile on acquisition and performance of spatial tasks in rats. Abstract 3,3′-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) has been reported to disrupt learning and memory in rats (24). The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.',\n 'Neuron-specific expression of a hamster prion protein minigene in transgenic mice induces susceptibility to hamster scrapie agent. Abstract To study the effect of cell type-restricted hamster PrP expression on susceptibility to the hamster scrapie agent, we generated transgenic mice using a 1 kb hamster cDNA clone containing the 0.76 kb HPrP open reading frame under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. In these mice, expression of HPrP was detected only in brain tissue, with highest levels found in neurons of the cerebellu, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. These transgenic mice were susceptible to infection by the 263K strain of hamster scrapie with an average incubation period of 93 days, compared to 72 days in normal hamsters. In contrast, nontransgenic mice were not susceptible to this agent. These results indicate that neuron-specific expression of the 1 kb HPrP minigene including the HPrP open-reading frame is sufficient to mediate susceptibility to hamster scraple, and that HPrP expression in nonneuronal brain cells is not necessary to overcome the TSE species barrier.',\n \"Adjuvant oils induce arthritis in the DA rat. I. Characterization of the disease and evidence for an immunological involvement. Abstract An intradermal injection of Freund's incomplete adjuvant oil (FIA) without further additives was shown to induce erosive polyarthritis in dark Agouti (DA) rats, but not in Lewis rats. Histological examination revealed joint inflammation, first with polymorphonuclear cells and synovial hyperplasia, and subsequently, with multinucleated giant cells. Both constituents of FIA, mineral oil and Arlacel® A, as well as Pristane oil were arthritogenic, whereas vegetable oils were not. Re-administration of adjuvant oil after recovery failed to induce arthritis, thus making possible a role of specific immunity in this new form of arthritis in rats.\",\n 'Rotavirus excretion by kids in a naturally infected goat herd. Abstract A cross-sectional study was carried out in a dairy goat herd, investigating the presence of rotavirus by means of ELISA, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two latex agglutination tests in feces of 63 goat kids younger than 1 month, with and without diarrhea, and in feces of 19 adult goats during the first few days after parturition. All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the León province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain. The possible mechanisms of viral diffusion within the herd and its role as pathogen in goats are discussed.',\n 'Characterization of blood mononuclear cells producing IFNα following induction by coronavirus-infected cells (porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus). Abstract Porcine blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were shown to produce interferon-α (IFNα) following incubation with cells infected by a coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities for leukocyte subsets and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were used to characterize IFNα producer cells. The production of IFNα was found to be a function of non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4+ (and to a lesser extent CD8+) MHC-class-II-positive cells. Furthermore, addition of anti-MHC (class II) mAb during PBMC incubation with virus-infected cells reduced IFN yields, suggesting that masking of these surface antigens alters PBMC responsiveness to IFN induction.',\n 'A role for CD8+ T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Abstract Experimental and clinical evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that CD8+ T lymphocytes aimed at suppressing HIV replication in infected CD4+ T cells may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS by directly causing a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers. Possible models to test this hypothesis are discussed.',\n 'Enrichment of coronavirus-induced interferon-producing blood leukocytes increases the interferon yield per cell: A study with pig leukocytes. Summary Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which secrete IFNα in response to a coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, were detected by a filter immunoplaque assay (ELISPOT). IFNα-producing cells (IPC), which are present at a low frequency in the blood, could be enriched up to 100-fold by sequential depletion of plastic-adherent cells and cell fractionation on metrizamide density gradients. IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation. Cell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-II Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations. These data suggest that IPC represent a unique and distinct cell population in the blood, which could secrete higher amounts of IFN following its accumulation at a site of viral infection.',\n 'Expression vectors for quatitating in vivo translational ambiguity: Their potential use to analyse frameshifting at the HIV gag-pol junction. Abstract Translational errors are necessary so as to allow gene expression in various organisms. In retroviruses, synthesis of pol gene products necessitates either readthrough of a stop codon or frameshifting. Here we present an experimental system that permits quantification of translational errors in vivo. It consists of a family of expression vectors carrying different mutated versions of the luc gene as reporter. Mutations include both an in-frame stop codon and 1-base-pair deletions that require readthough or frameshift, respectively, to give rise to an active product. This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in mammalian cells. In addition, one of the vectors contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of interest. This latter vector was used to analyse the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level slippage at the gag-pol junction of HIV. The effect of paromomycin and kasugamycin, two antibiotics known to influence translational ambiguity, was also tested in cultured cells. The results indicate that paromomycin diversely affects readthrough and frameshifting, while kasugamycin had no effect. This family of vectors can be used to analyse the influence of structural and external factors on translational ambiguity in both mammalian cells and bacteria.',\n 'Sequence and analysis of BECV F15 matrix protein. Abstract Clones from the bovine enteric coronavirus (F15) cDNA library were cloned in pBR322 and sequenced by the method of Sanger and Coulson. This led to the identification of a sequence of 1,300 bases which contained a single open reading frame of 690 bases yielding a protein having properties of the matrix protein (M). It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of +8 at neutral pH. Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity. A hypothesis is that, as it seems to possess the necessary information on its transmembrane region, it is an ideal candidate for the viral budding process.',\n 'Increased susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) infection induced by a hypercholesterolaemic diet with increased adsorption of MHV3 to primary hepatocyte cultures. Abstract The administration of a hypercholesterolaemic (HC) diet rendered genetically resistant A/J mice susceptible to mouse hepatitis 3 (MHV3) infection. The animals died cf acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This of modification by pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption. We hypothesize that the incorporation of cholesterol into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes of HC mice, thereby decreasing the membrane fluidity, may lead to an increase in the availability of virus receptors.',\n \"Le virus respiratoire syncytial: importance en pathologie, méthodes diagnostiques, traitement et prévention. Les bronchiolites à VRS sont fréquentes, épidémiques et nécessitent parfois l'hospitalisation des nourrissons, voire une réanimation. Le déterminisme des lésions pulmonaires est complexe, lié au virus et à la réaction immunitaire. Le traitement est symptomatique, et l'utilisation de la ribavirine est limitée aux formes sévères. Le diagnostic virologique doit être rapide, et la recherche immunologique directe des protéines virales est la technique la plus utilisée\",\n 'The use of macrolides in respiratory tract infections. Macrolides have enjoyed continued use for over 40 years, being increasingly usedfor the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Newer macrolides have been introduced that show improved absorption after oral administration, better gastrointestinal tolerance, and delivery of increased amounts of drug to the infection site. Macrolides are commonly used in community-acquired pneumonia, as well as in atypical pneumonia and legionellosis. The newer macrolides, in comparative studies, have been shown to be as effective as the conventional therapies for treating acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and acute pharyngitis, with a low incidence of side-effects. However, dosing can be simplified because of their unique pharmacokinetic properties. Limitations in the use of macrolides for respiratory infections include rather marginal activity in the most severe cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections, lack of activity against Klebsiella and other coliforms, which precludes their use as single agents in the therapy of pneumonia in patients with significant underlying disease or in the elderly, and development of resistance in streptococci and staphylococci.',\n 'Biological response modifiers and infectious diseases: Actual and potential therapeutic agents. Abstract Biological response modifiers (BRMs) are agents which can modify the immune response to cancer or invasion of the organism by infectious agents. An explosive appearance of new BRMs has resulted from the development of recombinant gene technology and the availability of monoclonal antibodies. Colony-stimulating factors first became available for the prevention of neutropenia but may also have a role in the treatment of infections. Interleukin-1 is being tested as a modular of hematopoiesis and may be useful as a helper factor for T- and B-cell function. Immunoglobulins are being used against viral and bacterial infections while interferons can prevent viral upper respiratory infections and suppress or irradicate some viral hepatitides. Other BRMs which show promise include chemical agents and traditional herbal medicines.',\n 'Deficiency in interferon production by leukocytes from children with recurrent respiratory infections. Abstract In vitro interferon production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections was examined, and compared with that of 50 healthy children. Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.',\n 'Comparison of monoclonal biotin-avidin enzyme immunoassay and monoclonal time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay in detection of respiratory virus antigens. Abstract Background: Detection of respiratory viruses by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based on monoclonal antibodies were developed in our laboratories in the late 1980s and they have been successfully used in daily diagnosis for more than seven years. Later, similar Biotin-EIAs were developed but the sensitivities were unsatisfactory. Objectives: Further optimization of monoclonal Biotin-EIAs and comparison of the optimized assays with TR-FIAs. Study design: Variations in test format, diluents, incubation times and temperatures, and different monoclonal antibodies were tested, and the final comparisons were made with TR-FIA using stored nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: The improvements in Biotin-EIA featured four changes which increased sensitivity in the assay: (a) test diluent contained diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid; (b) antigen and biotinylated detector antibody were added simultaneously; (c) reaction time was extended from 1 h at 37°C to overnight at 4°C; (d) from the thirteen monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA, ten were optimal also in Biotin-EIA, but in the parainfluenza 1 and 2 assays other monoclonals proved more sensitive. Out of 257 originally positive specimens tested in the comparison studies, 192 (74.7%) were again positive and 54 (21.0%) were negative in both assays; nine were negative in TR-FIA but positive in Biotin-EIA, while two specimens were negative in Biotin-EIA but positive in TR-FIA. The overall agreement between the two assays was 95.7%. Conclusions: All monoclonal Biotin-EIAs can be optimized to the same sensitivity as TR-FIAs for the detection of respiratory viruses. Laboratories which have no TR-FIA expertise may use Biotin-EIA in the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.',\n 'Antigen detection in human respiratory Coronavirus infections by monoclonal time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. Abstract Background: The diagnosis of respiratory infections by detecting viral antigens has received considerable attention using immunofluorescent assays (IFA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) has been developed for several viruses. Objectives: To prepare monoclonal antibodies to coronavirus strains, to incorporate them into a TR-FIA, and test the assay on clinical specimens. Study design: Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the N nucleoprotein of the two human respiratory coronaviruses, HCV strains 229E and OC43. Monoclonals to both viruses were completely type-specific; they did not cross-react between themselves or with multiple strains of other respiratory viruses. These antibodies were configured into optimized EIA and TR-FIA tests. The all-monoclonal tests were then compared to polyclonal EIA tests in terms of their ability to detect virus in clinical specimens. Results: The all-monoclonal TR-FIA was uniformly the most sensitive, detecting virus in all 13 229E-positive specimens compared to 69% for the monoclonal EIA and 54% for the polyclonal EIA test. Similar results were obtained for 10 OC43-positive specimens: 100% in TR-FIA, 90% in monoclonal EIA, and 80% in polyclonal EIA. For 229E in TR-FIA, mean positive/negative (P/N) ratios were 143 for 229E-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast (HLF) cell culture fluids and 10 for positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens; for OC43 in TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 964 for OC43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell culture fluids and 174 for positive NPA specimens. The sensitivities of the TR-FIA were determined with purified virions to be 0.308 ng virus per well for HCV-229E and 0.098 ng virus per well for HCV-OC43. Conclusions: This rapid and sensitive test appears to be much more sensitive than traditional antigen detection assays but will require more extensive field testing on clinical specimens.',\n 'Detection of respiratory syncytial virus infection in nasal aspirate samples by flow cytometry. Abstract Hypotheses: (i) Flow cytometry has the potential for rapid detection of respiratory viral antigens. (ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Further evaluation of the potential of flow cytometry in rapid viral diagnosis is warranted.',\n 'Virus-induced interferon production in leukocyte cultures from children with recurrent respiratory infections. A follow-up study. Abstract Background: Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon (IFN) by leukocyte cultures were previously suggested to be associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Pitkäranta et al. (1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.',\n 'Advances in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Abstract Background: Advances have been made in selecting sensitive cell lines for isolation, in early detection of respiratory virus growth in cells by rapid culture assays, in production of monoclonal antibodies to improve many tests such as immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates, in highly sensitive antigen detections by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (BIOTH-E), and, finally, in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of respiratory virus DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.',\n 'Viruses that multiply in the gut and cause endemic and epidemic gastroenteritis. Abstract Background: Acute infectious diarrhea in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found. Patient management may involve the employment of IV replacement therapy to counter dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Milder cases may be managed with oral rehydration.',\n 'Pathogens in livestock waste, their potential for movement through soil and environmental pollution. Abstract Livestock wastes contain many pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.',\n '7 Infectious diarrhoea in tropical and subtropical regions. Abstract Diarrhoeal diseases are among the most important health problems in the world today. While they are generally mild, nuisance illnesses in the developed world, where clean water and sanitation are adequate, these diseases are the most common cause of death in young children in the developing world, where clean water is not available and sanitation is inadequate. In these areas, up to 25% of children may never reach their fifth birthday. In addition, although the impact on growth and nutritional status is difficult to quantify, the cumulative toll on overall child health is enormous. A wide variety of infectious agents are implicated in the aetiology of acute diarrhoeal illness, many of which were unknown 20 years ago. The epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms and clinical presentation of the common bacterial and viral pathogens, as they are currently understood, will be discussed in this chapter.',\n '12 Pseudo-obstruction syndromes. Abstract Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and signs of intestinal occlusion, in absence of any mechanical obstruction of the gut lumen. It causes impaired transit of intestinal contents and is determined by abnormalities of motor activity. The term CIP is used to indicate a heterogeneous group of disorders with many different pathogenic mechanisms. The defect in the regulation of intestinal transit can be at any level of motility control. Two main types of CIP are recognized, termed respectively myogenic (when smooth muscle cells are affected) and neurogenic (caused by abnormalities of extrinsic and/or intrinsic nervous supplies). Both types may be secondary to a variety of recognizable diseases or idiopathic. In myogenic CIP, intestinal transit is impaired because of lack of propulsive strength; in the neurogenic form, contractions are powerful but not sufficiently co-ordinated to propel intestinal contents aborally in an organized fashion. CIP belongs to the large and loosely defined group of digestive functional disorders. These disorders probably share common pathogenic mechanisms but with different expressiveness. The reasons why only some patients present recurrent symptomatological bouts resembling mechanical occlusion has not been clarified. This aspect is of great clinical relevance and deserves attention, as CIP patients, unlike other patients with severe functional disorders, may undergo repeated, useless and potentially dangerous operations. The diagnosis of CIP may be suggested by clinical features and is based on radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and histological findings. Recent technological improvements facilitate the recognition of this intriguing syndrome. In particular, manometric recording of the small bowel motility, which has long been considered an important research technique, can now also be regarded as a useful diagnostic tool.',\n 'Viruses. Abstract Increased knowledge has been gained into the aetiology and pathogenesis of viral gastroenteritis during the past two decades. There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed.',\n 'Apoptosis in brain-specific autoimmune disease. Abstract Recent neuropathological studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have focused attention on the high number of cells in the lesions that show typical morphological features of apoptosis. Surprisingly, it has turned out that the vast majority of apoptotic cells are T lymphocytes and that they actually represent the antigen-specific T-cell population responsible for the induction of the disease. Taken together, these data suggest that clearance of autoimmune inflammation in the nervous system is accomplished by the destruction of the antigen-specific T-cell population within the lesions. This may explain the low level of central nervous system specific T-cell memory formation, as well as previously unexplained phenomena of ‘epitope spreading’, in autoimmune inflammation of the nervous system',\n 'Ribosomal frameshifting, jumping and readthrough. Abstract New examples of high-level ribosomal frameshift and readthrough events have been described over the past year and a half. These include −1 frameshifiting at tandem codons and + 1 frameshifiting at neighboring slow codons. Several bizarre examples of ribosome jumping and multiple stop-codon readthrough continue to perplex investigators in this field.',\n 'The endoplasmic reticulum—Golgi intermediate compartment. Abstract The recent identification of an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment has added to the complexity of the structural and functional organization of the early secretory pathway. Protein sorting along the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway depends on different signals and mechanisms, some of which guarantee recycling from various levels of the Golgi apparatus to biosynthetically earlier compartments.',\n 'Translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum. Abstract The past year has seen significant advances in the field of protein translocation: the roles of the signal recognition particle and its receptor have been understood in greater detail; many membrane components responsible for translocation have been identified; and insight has been gained into how proteins cross membranes.',\n 'Targeting and retention of Golgi membrane proteins. Abstract Recent cloning of genes encoding membrane proteins of the Golgi complex has allowed investigation of protein targeting to this organelle. Targeting signals have been identified in three glycosyltransferases, a viral envelope protein and several proteins of the trans-Golgi network. Interestingly, the targeting signals for membrane proteins of the Golgi stacks seem to be contained in transmembrane domains. Information in the cytoplasmic tails is required for the targeting of trans-Golgi network proteins. Mechanisms involving both retention and retrieval have been invoked.',\n 'Retention and retrieval in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Abstract Resident proteins of the exocytic pathway contain at least two types of information in their primary sequence for determining their subcellular location. The first type of information is found at the carboxyl terminus of soluble proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the cytoplasmic domain of some ER and Golgi membrane proteins. It acts as a retrieval signal, returning proteins that have left the compartment in which they reside. The second type of information has been found in the membrane-spanning domain of several ER and Golgi proteins and, though the mechanism by which it operates is still unclear, it acts as a retention signal, keeping the protein at a particular location within the organelle. The presence of both a retrieval signal and a retention signal in a trans-Golgi network resident protein suggests that more than one mechanism operates to ensure correct localization of resident proteins along the exocytic pathway.',\n 'Aquaporin water channels: unanswered questions and unresolved controversies. Abstract The long-standing biophysical question of how water crosses plasma membranes has been answered by the recent discovery of the aquaporins. Identification of this large family of membrane water-transport proteins has generated new questions about the physiological functions, tissue distributions, and regulatory mechanisms of individual aquaporins. The fast pace of developments in this field has also resulted in major discrepancies in published reports which warrant resolution.',\n 'Examples of expression systems based on animal RNA viruses: Alphaviruses and influenza virus. Abstract Successful recovery of RNA viruses and functional RNA replicons from cDNA has greatly facilitated molecular genetic analyses of viral proteins and cis-regulatory elements. This technology allows the use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences. Both positive-strand and negative-strand animal RNA viruses have been engineered to produce chimeric viruses expressing protective epitopes from other pathogens and for transient expression of heterologous sequences.',\n 'Gene regulation: translational initiation by internal ribosome binding. Abstract During the past year, several examples of cellular mRNAs have been described in which translational initiation occurs by internal ribosome binding, a mechanism hitherto thought to be restricted to picornaviral RNAs. New insights into the molecular mechanism of internal ribosome entry have been provided by the structural and functional analyses of both the internal ribosome entry sites and the protein factors that stimulate translation mediated by these elements.',\n 'Virus — cell interactions in the nervous system and the role of the immune response. Abstract The outcome of a viral infection within the nervous system depends on a complex interplay between the virus, its target cell and the immune system. Recent research has elucidated a variety of mechanisms involved in these interactions and their role in the production of disease.',\n 'Helix-helix interactions inside lipid bilayers. Abstract Far from being simple hydrophobic anchors, it is now clear that the transmembrane α-helices of integral membrane proteins can participate in strong, specific interactions that are important in their folding and oligomerization. Crystallographic studies of 21 such helices have indicated that these interactions are similar to those described for soluble proteins. Helix-helix interactions are also important in the oligomerization of a number of proteins that have a single transmembrane α-helix. The interactions are rather specific, involving interhelical salt bridges, hydrogen bonds or precise packing interactions. In some cases, such oligomerization is required for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The transmembrane helices of some Golgi-residing proteins also contain sufficient information to ensure their retention in this compartment. Finally, interactions between transmembrane α-helices may be important in the mechanism of transmembrane signalling by a number of membrane-bound receptors.',\n 'RNA pseudoknots. Abstract RNA pseudoknots result from Watson-Crick base pairing involving a stretch of bases located between paired strands and a distal single-stranded region. Recently, significant advances in our understanding of their structural and functional aspects have been accomplished. At the structural level, modelling and NMR studies have shown that a defined subset of pseudoknots may be considered as tertiary motifs in RNA foldings. At the functional level, there is evidence that the realm of functions encompassed by RNA pseudoknots extends from the control of translation in prokaryotes, retroviruses and coronaviruses to the control of catalytic activity in ribozymes and the control of replication in some plant viruses.',\n 'Integral membrane protein structure: transmembrane α-helices as autonomous folding domains Current opinion in structural biology 1993, 3: 532–540. Abstract The transmembrane region of many integral membrane proteins is made up of a bundle of hydrophobic α-helices. Such a structure could result from a two-stage folding process, during which preformed transmembrane helices with independent stability pack without topological rearrangement. This view was originally prompted by experiments in which fragments of transmembrane regions were separately refolded into lipid bilayers and subsequently brought together to yield a functional protein. Other lines of evidence, including the existence of ‘one-helix’ miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view. Although it forms a useful basis for structural predictions, the limitations of the two-stage folding hypothesis are not clearly defined, and the proportion of integral membrane proteins to which it applies remains uncertain. The papers discussed in the present review illustrate recent progress along these lines.',\n 'Viral diseases of fish in Japan. Abstract Viruses causing infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) were first isolated in Japan during the 1970s and these two diseases remain among the most serious problems affecting cultured salmonids in Japan. In addition to IHN and IPN, four other viral diseases cause major economic losses among cultured fishes in Japan. These include viral pancreatic hepatic necrosis of yellowtail, rhabdovirus infection of Japanese flounder and black rock fish, Kuchishiro-sho of tiger puffer fish, and epidermal hyperplasia or necrosis of Japanese flounder. Over the years, a number of other viruses have been isolated from, or have been observed by electron microscopy, in moribund fish. Members of 10 of the existing families of animal viruses are represented in this group. Their importance to the aquaculture industry in Japan is reviewed here.',\n 'New viruses described in finfish from 1988–1992. Abstract A number of new virus isolates from finfish have been reported in the scientific literature during the past five years. These include nine aquareoviruses, eight picornaviruses, six iridoviruses, five herpesviruses, three rhabdoviruses, three retroviruses, a paramyxovirus, and a coronavirus. Not all of these agents have been isolated in cell culture or established as etiologic agents of disease by controlled transmission studies. The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale. This review chronicles the new virus isolates and lists them with other members of their virus family where appropriate.',\n 'Viral infections of aquatic animals with special reference to Asian aquaculture. Abstract Worldwide, the number of communicable diseases of animals raised in aquaculture continue to increase. Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years. In the Asian regions, penaeid shrimp and several teleost fish underwent epizootics associated with heavy losses in aquaculture. Baculoviruses are particularly harmful to shrimp and prawns. Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.',\n 'Golgi retention signals: do membranes hold the key?. Abstract The diverse forms and functions of cellular organelles are, presumably, a consequence of their particular molecular compositions. The generation and maintenance of this diversity is achieved by the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to specific locations and their subsequent retention there. Sequences that retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been identified at the C-termini of resident ER proteins, where they are readily accessible to potential receptors. By contrast, recent results have demonstrated that retention of proteins in the Golgi complex involves sequences located within transmembrane domains. This suggests the novel possibility that the membrane composition of the Golgi complex plays a role in retention of resident Golgi proteins.',\n 'Adaptive surface variation in mycoplasmas. Abstract Mycoplasmas excel as infectious agents, despite their very small genomes. In one mycoplasma species, adaptive flexibility is enhanced by an elegant genetic system that diversifies the membrane surface through a set of variable lipoproteins (Vlps). A family of vlp genes supplies divergent coding sequences and undergoes high-frequency mutations, thus creating large repertoires of surface mosaics and structural variants.',\n 'Antibody-mediated clearance of viruses from the mammalian central nervous system. Abstract The novel role of antibody in clearing virus from the central nervous system without the help of other immune effectors is an important phenomenon that has only recently been documented. Possible routes for antibodies across the blood-brain barrier and how they work in the CNS are discussed here.',\n 'Protease-dependent virus tropism and pathogenicity. Abstract Viral tissue tropism in a susceptible host is often determined by virus-receptor interactions. Nevertheless, closely related viruses utilizing the same receptor molecules can display striking differences in tropism, or a virus can cause a localized infection despite the widespread occurrence of the receptor. These events are now explained by another mechanism of tropism, in which host proteases play a major role by activating viral fusion glycoproteins.',\n 'Targeting of viral glycoproteins to the Golgi complex. Abstract Certain enveloped viruses are known to assemble on membranes of the Golgi complex. Intracellular budding is facilitated by targeting of the viral glycoproteins to this organelle. It is likely that these viral glycoproteins are retained in the Golgi by the same means as are endogenous Golgi proteins. Consequently, the study of Golgi-specific viral proteins has provided important clues to the nature of Golgi retention signals.',\n 'Plant virus proteins involved in natural vector transmission. Abstract Plant viruses transmitted by invertebrate vectors either reversibly bind to vector mouthparts or are internalized by the vector and later secreted. Viral proteins mediate the binding of plant viruses to vector mouthparts and the transport of virus across vector-cell membranes. Both mechanisms probably involve conformational changes of virus proteins during their association with the vector.',\n 'The murine coronavirus as a model of trafficking and assembly of viral proteins in neural tissue. Abstract The replication of JHM, a murine coronavirus, provides a useful model of the assembly and dissemination of viral components in neuronal cells. Involvement of microtubules in virus trafficking is an important feature which may explain dissemination of the infection from primary cell targets at olfactory, hippocampal and cerebellar sites within the central nervous system, resulting in severe neuropathies.',\n 'Long-term humoral immunity against viruses: revisiting the issue of plasma cell longevity. Despite extensive documentation of prolonged antibody responses following vaccination or acute viral infection, the mechanisms behind long-term antibody production are not fully understood. We propose the hypothesis that long-lived plasma cells are an important, yet largely overlooked, component of long-term humoral immunity.',\n 'Genetic engineering of animal RNA viruses. The ability to genetically manipulate viruses has led to extraordinary advances in understanding virus biology and to the establishment of useful vector systems. Initially confined to DNA viruses and retroviruses, RNA viruses have more recently become attractive candidates for expression of heterologous genes and offer promising perspectives for biomedical applications.',\n 'Acylation of proteins — a new type of modification of membrane glycoproteins. Abstract Fatty acids are covalently attached to many membrane glycoproteins during their biosynthesis.',\n 'The novel glycoproteins of coronaviruses. Abstract The two glycoproteins of coronavirus envelopes have different functions in intracellular budding, cytopathic effects and virus infectivity, and have markedly different biochemical properties.',\n 'Revelation through exploitation: the viral model for intracellular traffic. Abstract Enveloped viruses exploit the existing routes of membrane traffic to enter and leave the host cell. The similarity between viral envelopes and cellular membranes has allowed the use of animal viruses as probes to examine aspects of intracellular traffic.',\n 'The where, what and how of ribosomal frameshifting in retroviral protein synthesis. Abstract The gag and pol genes of most retroviruses occur in different reading frames and their translation as a single polypeptide is carried out by ribosomal frameshifting in the −1 direction. The alignment of the different reading frames occurs by overlapping reading in response to at least two signals within the RNA: one is a heptanucleotide stretch at the frameshift site and the other is a stem-loop structure which occurs just downstream of the first signal.',\n 'Packaging and unpackaging the sea urchin sperm genome. Abstract Two species of histones in sea urchin sperm (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) are chimeric molecules whose highly basic amino-terminal domains are dephosphorylated at the last stage of sperm cell differentiation, and rephosphorylated immediately following fertilization. The phosphorylated regions consist largely of repeating tetrapeptides with two basic residues flanking Ser-Pro residues (‘SPKK’ motifs) and are predicted to have β-turn secondary structures. Alteration of the charge and structure of the SPKK sites may play a role in the unusually dense DNA packaging of the mature sperm chromatin. The motif resembles the target site of cell-cycle-associated cdc2 kinases and is found in several other proteins whose nucleic acid affinities may be altered during the cell cycle.',\n 'The ultrastructure of multinucleate giant cells. Abstract A survey of the available ultrastructural data on physiologically and pathologically occurring and virally-induced multinucleate giant cells (MNGCs) is presented. Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4+ population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.',\n 'Pathways of protein sorting and membrane traffic between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Abstract Recent results have provided increasing evidence for the existence of an intermediate membrane compartment between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex which seems to function in protein sorting and the regulation of membrane traffic in the early part of the exocytic pathway. Localization of resident marker proteins has shown that this compartment consists of both peripheral and central elements. The aim of the present review is to combine the data on the pre-Golgi compartment with previous ideas of membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi interface. We propose a model which describes how mobile, endosome-like elements of the pre-Golgi compartment function in the generation of the compositional and functional boundary between the widely distributed ER and the more centrally located Golgi stacks.',\n 'Cell biology of viruses that assemble along the biosynthetic pathway. Abstract In this review we discuss five groups of viruses that bud into, or assemble from, different compartments along the biosynthetic pathway. These are herpes-, rota-, corona-, bunya- and poxviruses. Our main emphasis will be on the virally-encoded membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for determining the site of virus assembly. In a number of cases these proteins have been well characterized and appear to serve as resident markers of the budding compartments. The assembly and dissemination of these viruses raises many questions of cell biological interest.',\n 'Viral pathogenesis and central nervous system infection. Abstract Both host defense and viral genetic factors influence the development of viral infection and disease. Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, infection of the central nervous system creates additional complexities in interactions between a virus and its host. Stages in viral pathogenesis defined as (1) virus entry, (2) spread, (3) tropism, (4) virulence and injury to the host, and (5) the outcome of infection are discussed for viral infections in general and those aspects unique to infections of the central nervous system. Information about neuronal physiology and function has also been revealed through studying virus infection. An increased understanding of viral pathogenetic mechanisms and host response to infection raises interesting possibilities for vaccine development and for basic studies in neurology and neurobiology.',\n 'The immune system response to viral infection of the CNS. Abstract In immunological terms the CNS is at a severe disadvantage in its ability to respond to infection by virus. First, both glial and neuronal cells normally do not express molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Second, the most efficient cells for stimulating an immune response (leucocyte dendritic cells) are not present in the healthy CNS; and third, there is no specialized lymphatic drainage from the CNS to lymph nodes to enable the immune system to be quickly informed of the presence of an infection. Nevertheless, the immune system apparently copes with the vast majority of viral infections in the CNS. This is clearly evidenced by the reactivation of latent CNS viral infections in some immunosuppressed patients and the dramatic increase in the seventy of CNS disease in young or otherwise immunologically incompetent experimental animals infected with neurotropic viruses. The routes by which the CNS and the immune system may communicate and the varied ways in which an immune response may affect the outcome of a viral infection of the CNS are discussed.',\n \"Virological and pathological processes involved in Theiler's virus infection of the central nervous system. Abstract Theiler's virus strains GDVII and FA cause an acute encephalitis when injected intracerebrally into mice, whereas strains To, BeAn and DA establish a persistent infection and produce a chronic demyelinating disease. The chronic infection is also dependent on the mouse strain used, with susceptibility linked in part to the D locus of the MHC. The region of the virus genome associated with neurovirulence maps to the P1 region, encoding the capsid proteins, and to the 5′ non-coding region. There is evidence that BeAn DA virus persists in oligodendrocytes, where it reactivates to initiate demyelinating disease. Host factors are involved in the development of the lesion, including CD4+ T cell responses. These lymphocytes most probably mediate damage through activation of macrophages leading to local destruction of glial cells. Another possible pathological role for the immune system is the recognition of nerve cell antigens and the initiation of autoimmune disease. Such a virus-triggered phenomenon may well underlie human CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\",\n 'Viral infections of the developing nervous system. Abstract Both clinical and experimental studies indicate that viruses can interact with the developing nervous system to produce a spectrum of neurological damage and brain malformations. Following infection of the pregnant woman, virus may indirectly or directly involve the fetus. Direct involvement is generally due to transplacental passage of the virus and invasion of fetal tissue. Resultant disease is determined by a variety of virus-host factors, including the developmental stage of the fetus at the time it is infected, the neural cell populations which are susceptible to infection, the consequent virus-infected cell interactions, and the mechanism and timing of viral clearance. There is a growing list of human viruses which injure the developing nervous system. There are also several experimental models in which congenital viral infections have been shown to result in a variety of brain malformations but with no evidence of the prior infection remaining at the time of birth.',\n 'Major histocompatibility complex molecules on glial cells. Abstract While glial cells of the central nervous system do not constitutively express class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, astrocytes and microglial cells can be induced by a variety of factors to express these antigens. Oligodendrocytes have inducible class I but not class II elements. There are considerable differences in regulation of MHC antigen expression between glial cells from rodent and human brains, both in situ and in vitro. The consequence of glial cell MHC expression for immune interactions in the CNS is discussed in the context of glial cell antigen presentation capacity and neural cell susceptibility to cell-mediated immune effector mechanisms.',\n 'A quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) antibody. Abstract A quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect and measure antibody to bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) in cattle sera. The optical density produced from a single dilution of test serum was compared with a standard curve and the results were read and printed out from a computer interfaced to a multichannel ELISA reader. The printed results were expressed in ELISA units. The ELISA results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test (SNT). An agreement of 90·5% was obtained when reciprocal SNT titres equal to or greater than 4 and IgG ELISA units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction. Of the 370 sera, 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were SNT positive/IgG ELISA negative and 14 were SNT negative/IgG ELISA positive. When the SNT positive sera negative in the IgG ELISA were tested in an IgM ELISA, 19 were found to be positive. Thus, when the IgG and IgM ELISA results were combined the overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT increased to 95·7%. The IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 82·4% and specificity of 94·4% relative to the SNT, whereas the combined IgG and IgM ELISA results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98·3% and 94·4% respectively. There was a good positive correlation between the two tests (r = 0·86).',\n 'Inactivation and stability of viral diagnostic reagents treated by gamma radiation. Abstract The objective of this study was to apply the pertinent findings from gamma inactivation of virus infectivity to the production of high quality diagnostic reagents. A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canada § § Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0·42 to 3·7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1·7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza N1 and B neuraminidase occurred with >2·4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability. Gamma radiation is safer than chemical inactivation procedures and is a reliable and effective replacement for BPL in preparing diagnostic reagents.',\n 'RNA pseudoknots downstream of the frameshift sites of retroviruses. Abstract RNA pseudoknot structural motifs could have implications for a wide range of biological processes of RNAs. In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al. [2, 3].',\n \"Viral etiology of Parkinson's disease: Focus on influenza A virus. Abstract Some clinical reports and epidemiological data suggest that a virus may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.\",\n 'Aetiology of asthma: how public health and molecular medicine work together. Abstract Astham is recognized as the most common treatable chronic disease of the lung, afflicting over 100 million people of all age groups yet, despite therapeutic advances, there has been little impact on the rising morbidity and mortality from the disease. This article discusses ways in which molecular medicine can inform public health policy and clinical practice in the management of asthma. It focuses on the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory disorder, and that the public health burden of the disease can be reduced by identifying environmental factors that may trigger asthma in genetically susceptible individuals.',\n '1.13 The Role of Small- or Medium-Sized Enterprises in Drug Discovery. The past 10 years has seen the rise of large numbers of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) engaging in some or many of the aspects of drug research. Few of these companies have been able to take candidate drugs to market due to development costs not being met by funding opportunities, but those companies that have been able to challenge traditional big pharma in the marketplace. Most SMEs have instead supplied traditional pharma with pipeline candidate drugs, either by licensing them or by the large companies actually acquiring the whole of the SME which owns the intellectual property. Many other companies engage in providing traditional big pharma or other SMEs with technologies and services. Hundreds of such companies have arisen, many clustered around centres of academic excellence on the coasts of the USA, or in certain regions in Europe and Asia – such clustering of scientific prowess has changed the location of where even big pharma tends to perform its research. By 2006, a large proportion (but generally less than 50%) of new drugs could be track to an origin in an SME, trends indicate that the proportion will rise even though the common prediction that large pharma will abandon internal research in favour of in-licensing from SMEs remains far from reality.',\n '1.22 Bioethical Issues in Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Treatment. The use of drugs to treat human disease is a pursuit that extends back into our evolutionary ancestors. Drugs are powerful substances with a great capacity to cause harm if misused or overused. Even when used correctly, pharmaceuticals can elicit disputes about their relative harms and benefits in specific situations. The establishment of modern intermediaries – physicians or pharmacists – in the allocation of the most powerful drugs increases the potential for conflict between those who control the resource and those who desire access to it. The size and influence of the pharmaceutical–industrial complex places disproportionate power in those whose interests lie in promoting and expanding pharmaceutical use in society. The expense of certain drugs complicates equitable allocation, and the concentration of pharmaceutical power in Western, industrialized countries promotes research and drug discovery disproportionately for diseases that are prevalent in the wealthier nations. The increasing sophistication of drug action challenges the traditional model of using drugs as a means to treat pathological conditions and processes, and raises the specter of lifestyle and enhancement uses of pharmaceuticals. New means of drug discovery – such as the use of stem cells – have elicited debate about the relative values placed on the status of the embryo and the potential treatment for intractable conditions that could result from stem cell research. Finally, the overall emphasis on drugs as the first line defense against what ails us has provoked some societal soul-searching. In this chapter, we review some of the ethical issues attendant to drug production and distribution, including issues of safety, justice, economic inequality, and the changing demands for drugs that exceed therapeutic uses. Suggestions are made to make pharmaceutical companies more responsive to these issues and to make oversight bodies more responsible for their roles.',\n '2.18 Promiscuous Ligands. Computational and experimental high-throughput screening are frequently used to discover new leads for drug design. Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30–1000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits. This chapter will review the known mechanisms of ligand promiscuity with an emphasis on the recently described model of aggregation. Experimental and computational methods for identifying promiscuous compounds will be described, and some outstanding questions in the field will be considered.',\n '7.10 Viruses and Viral Diseases. More than 40 compounds have been formally licensed for clinical use as antiviral drugs, and half of these are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others have been approved for the therapy of herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV)), hepadnavirus (hepatitis B virus (HBV)), hepacivirus (hepatitis C virus (HCV)), and myxovirus (influenza, respiratory synctural virus (RSV)) infections. New compounds are in clinical development or under preclinical evaluation, and, again, half of these target HIV infections. Yet, quite a number of important viral pathogens (i.e., human papilloma virus (HPV), HCV, hemorrhagic fever viruses) remain in need of effective and/or improved antiviral therapies.',\n '4.10 Comparative Modeling of Drug Target Proteins. In this perspective, we begin by describing the comparative protein structure modeling technique and the accuracy of the corresponding models. We then discuss the significant role that comparative prediction plays in drug discovery. We focus on virtual ligand screening against comparative models and illustrate the state of the art by a number of specific examples.',\n 'Subject Index. Unknown',\n 'Appendix. Unknown',\n \"BRONCHIOLITIS. Bronchiolitis is a common respiratory tract infection usually affecting infants and young children during annual epidemics. It is characterized by wheeze, respiratory distress, and poor feeding. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause for bronchiolitis and is amongst the most important pathogens causing respiratory infection in infants worldwide. The healthcare burden of bronchiolitis is large, due to large numbers of hospitalized infants and the high risk of nosocomial spread during epidemics. Most children will suffer only mild, short-lived symptoms. A small proportion will need admission to hospital, where treatment is generally supportive until the illness resolves. Some will require ventilatory support for which mortality can be up to 10%. Infants at high risk of severe disease include those born prematurely, those with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised infants. RSV infects ciliated epithelial cells, causing sloughing of the epithelium, cytokine and inflammatory mediator release, increases in mucus production, and interstitial edema. Clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis are a combined result of viral toxicity and the immune response to infection. Innate immune responses are important to the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, as severe infection tends to occur after maternal antibody protection has waned and before the infant's adaptive immune responses have matured. Immunoprophylaxis, in the form of intramuscular anti-RSV IgG1, is effective in reducing rates of hospitalization for high-risk infants.\",\n 'OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES | Overview. This overview describes the main categories of specific occupational disorders and it covers also how work exposures are potential determinants of common respiratory conditions. Acute inhalation injuries may present as inhalation fever or as acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis. Occupational asthma is the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers’ pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence. Similarly, bronchopulmonary cancer is not only caused by smoking, but also by occupational agents, most notably asbestos. Asbestos is also a cause of nonmalignant and malignant pleural disease.',\n ...]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Avoid least frequent and rare words"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clean_words = df['document'].tolist()\nclean_words[1]","execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":28,"data":{"text/plain":"'Clinical and immunologic studies in identical twins discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus.

Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization.
